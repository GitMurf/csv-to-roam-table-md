In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity,"},{"string":"3. The word of the LORD came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was there upon him."},{"string":"4. And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire."},{"string":"5. Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a man."},{"string":"6. And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings."},{"string":"7. And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot: and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass."},{"string":"8. And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings."},{"string":"9. Their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward."},{"string":"10. As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle."},{"string":"11.

As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings were full of eyes round about them four."},{"string":"19. And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up."},{"string":"20. Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither was their spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels."},{"string":"21. When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels."},{"string":"22.

And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies."},{"string":"24. And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their wings."},{"string":"25. And there was a voice from the firmament that was over their heads, when they stood, and had let down their wings."},{"string":"26. And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it."},{"string":"27. And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about."},{"string":"28. As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD.

And the names of them were Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her sister: and they were mine, and they bare sons and daughters. Thus were their names; Samaria is Aholah, and Jerusalem Aholibah."},{"string":"5. And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbours,"},{"string":"6. Which were clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses."},{"string":"7. Thus she committed her whoredoms with them, with all them that were the chosen men of Assyria, and with all on whom she doted: with all their idols she defiled herself."},{"string":"8.

Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted."},{"string":"10. These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword: and she became famous among women; for they had executed judgment upon her."},{"string":"11. And when her sister Aholibah saw this, she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she, and in her whoredoms more than her sister in her whoredoms."},{"string":"12. She doted upon the Assyrians her neighbours, captains and rulers clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable young men."},{"string":"13. Then I saw that she was defiled, that they took both one way,"},{"string":"14.

And there was an enlarging, and a winding about still upward to the side chambers: for the winding about of the house went still upward round about the house: therefore the breadth of the house was still upward, and so increased from the lowest chamber to the highest by the midst."},{"string":"8. I saw also the height of the house round about: the foundations of the side chambers were a full reed of six great cubits."},{"string":"9. The thickness of the wall, which was for the side chamber without, was five cubits: and that which was left was the place of the side chambers that were within."},{"string":"10. And between the chambers was the wideness of twenty cubits round about the house on every side."},{"string":"11. And the doors of the side chambers were toward the place that was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south: and the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits round about."},{"string":"12. Now the building that was before the separate place at the end toward the west was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about, and the length thereof ninety cubits."},{"string":"13.

From the ground unto above the door were cherubims and palm trees made, and on the wall of the temple."},{"string":"21. The posts of the temple were squared, and the face of the sanctuary; the appearance of the one as the appearance of the other."},{"string":"22. The altar of wood was three cubits high, and the length thereof two cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and the walls thereof, were of wood: and he said unto me, This is the table that is before the LORD."},{"string":"23. And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors."},{"string":"24. And the doors had two leaves apiece, two turning leaves; two leaves for the one door, and two leaves for the other door."},{"string":"25. And there were made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubims and palm trees, like as were made upon the walls; and there were thick planks upon the face of the porch without."},{"string":"26.

Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect is toward the east, and measured it round about."},{"string":"16.

And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh."},{"string":"12.

And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken."},{"string":"43. And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay."},{"string":"44. And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever."},{"string":"45. Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure."},{"string":"46. Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him."},{"string":"47.

Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up."},{"string":"4.

Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Then they brought these men before the king."},{"string":"14. Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, do not ye serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?"},{"string":"15. Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made; well: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?"},{"string":"16. Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this matter."},{"string":"17. If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king."},{"string":"18.

At the same time my reason returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, mine honour and brightness returned unto me; and my counsellors and my lords sought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added unto me."},{"string":"37.

And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh."},{"string":"6. After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it."},{"string":"7. After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns."},{"string":"8. I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things."},{"string":"9. I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire."},{"string":"10. A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened."},{"string":"11.

As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time."},{"string":"13. I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him."},{"string":"14.

Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom."},{"string":"23. Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces."},{"string":"24.

So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end shall be the vision."},{"string":"18. Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright."},{"string":"19.

And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee. And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour."},{"string":"14. And when Jesus was come into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother laid, and sick of a fever."},{"string":"15. And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose, and ministered unto them."},{"string":"16. When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with his word, and healed all that were sick:"},{"string":"17. That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses."},{"string":"18. Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave commandment to depart unto the other side."},{"string":"19. And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest."},{"string":"20. And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head."},{"string":"21. And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father."},{"string":"22. But Jesus said unto him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their dead."},{"string":"23. And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him."},{"string":"24. And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves: but he was asleep."},{"string":"25. And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying, Lord, save us: we perish."},{"string":"26. And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm."},{"string":"27. But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!"},{"string":"28. And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way."},{"string":"29. And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before the time?"},{"string":"30. And there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding."},{"string":"31. So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer us to go away into the herd of swine."},{"string":"32. And he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they went into the herd of swine: and, behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters."},{"string":"33. And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the city, and told every thing, and what was befallen to the possessed of the devils."},{"string":"34. And, behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus: and when they saw him, they besought him that he would depart out of their coasts."}]},{"title":"Matthew 9","children":[{"string":"1. And he entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into his own city."},{"string":"2. And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy; Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee."},{"string":"3. And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemeth."},{"string":"4. And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts?"},{"string":"5. For whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and walk?"},{"string":"6. But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (then saith he to the sick of the palsy,) Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house."},{"string":"7. And he arose, and departed to his house."},{"string":"8. But when the multitudes saw it, they marvelled, and glorified God, which had given such power unto men."},{"string":"9. And as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him."},{"string":"10. And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples."},{"string":"11. And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?"},{"string":"12. But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick."},{"string":"13. But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."},{"string":"14. Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not?"},{"string":"15. And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast."},{"string":"16. No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment, and the rent is made worse."},{"string":"17. Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish: but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved."},{"string":"18. While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live."},{"string":"19. And Jesus arose, and followed him, and so did his disciples."},{"string":"20. And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment:"},{"string":"21. For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole."},{"string":"22. But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said, Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour."},{"string":"23. And when Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise,"},{"string":"24. He said unto them, Give place: for the maid is not dead, but sleepeth.

And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him: and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They said unto him, Yea, Lord."},{"string":"29. Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it unto you."},{"string":"30. And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them, saying, See that no man know it."},{"string":"31. But they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in all that country."},{"string":"32. As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil."},{"string":"33. And when the devil was cast out, the dumb spake: and the multitudes marvelled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel."},{"string":"34. But the Pharisees said, He casteth out devils through the prince of the devils."},{"string":"35. And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people."},{"string":"36. But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd."},{"string":"37.

For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath."},{"string":"13. Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand."},{"string":"14. And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive:"},{"string":"15.

But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also."},{"string":"27. So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?"},{"string":"28. He said unto them, An enemy hath done this.

Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof."},{"string":"33.

But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny?"},{"string":"14. Take that thine is, and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even as unto thee."},{"string":"15. Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good?"},{"string":"16. So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen."},{"string":"17. And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and said unto them,"},{"string":"18. Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death,"},{"string":"19. And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify him: and the third day he shall rise again."},{"string":"20. Then came to him the mother of Zebedees children with her sons, worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him."},{"string":"21. And he said unto her, What wilt thou? She saith unto him, Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left, in thy kingdom."},{"string":"22. But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say unto him, We are able."},{"string":"23. And he saith unto them, Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father."},{"string":"24. And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation against the two brethren."},{"string":"25. But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them."},{"string":"26. But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister;"},{"string":"27. And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant:"},{"string":"28. Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many."},{"string":"29. And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed him."},{"string":"30. And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou son of David."},{"string":"31. And the multitude rebuked them, because they should hold their peace: but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou son of David."},{"string":"32. And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will ye that I shall do unto you?"},{"string":"33. They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened."},{"string":"34. So Jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes: and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him."}]},{"title":"Matthew 21","children":[{"string":"1.

And if any man say ought unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need of them; and straightway he will send them."},{"string":"4. All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying,"},{"string":"5.

And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them,"},{"string":"7. And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set him thereon."},{"string":"8. And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way; others cut down branches from the trees, and strawed them in the way."},{"string":"9. And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest."},{"string":"10. And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who is this?"},{"string":"11. And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee."},{"string":"12.

And said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves."},{"string":"14. And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he healed them."},{"string":"15. And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the son of David; they were sore displeased,"},{"string":"16.

And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and he lodged there."},{"string":"18. Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered."},{"string":"19. And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever. And presently the fig tree withered away."},{"string":"20. And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How soon is the fig tree withered away!"},{"string":"21. Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done."},{"string":"22. And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive."},{"string":"23. And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority?"},{"string":"24.

And he said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things."},{"string":"28. But what think ye? A certain man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard."},{"string":"29.

For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterward, that ye might believe him."},{"string":"33. Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country:"},{"string":"34. And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it."},{"string":"35.

Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?"},{"string":"43.

Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come unto the marriage."},{"string":"5. But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise:"},{"string":"6. And the remnant took his servants, and entreated them spitefully, and slew them."},{"string":"7. But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city."},{"string":"8. Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy."},{"string":"9. Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage."},{"string":"10. So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests."},{"string":"11. And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment:"},{"string":"12. And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless."},{"string":"13. Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness, there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth."},{"string":"14. For many are called, but few are chosen."},{"string":"15. Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk."},{"string":"16. And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou regardest not the person of men."},{"string":"17. Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not?"},{"string":"18. But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites?"},{"string":"19. Shew me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny."},{"string":"20. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription?"},{"string":"21. They say unto him, Caesar's.

The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,"},{"string":"24.

Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his brother:"},{"string":"26. Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh."},{"string":"27. And last of all the woman died also."},{"string":"28. Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her."},{"string":"29. Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God."},{"string":"30. For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven."},{"string":"31. But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,"},{"string":"32. I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living."},{"string":"33. And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine."},{"string":"34. But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together."},{"string":"35.

Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,"},{"string":"4.

Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,"},{"string":"7. There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat."},{"string":"8. But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste?"},{"string":"9. For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor."},{"string":"10. When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me."},{"string":"11. For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always."},{"string":"12. For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial."},{"string":"13. Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her."},{"string":"14. Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,"},{"string":"15. And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver."},{"string":"16. And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him."},{"string":"17. Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?"},{"string":"18. And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples."},{"string":"19. And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover."},{"string":"20. Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve."},{"string":"21. And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me."},{"string":"22. And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?"},{"string":"23. And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me."},{"string":"24. The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born."},{"string":"25.

Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples."},{"string":"36. Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder."},{"string":"37. And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy."},{"string":"38. Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me."},{"string":"39. And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt."},{"string":"40. And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?"},{"string":"41. Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."},{"string":"42. He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done."},{"string":"43. And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy."},{"string":"44. And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words."},{"string":"45. Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners."},{"string":"46.

And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people."},{"string":"48. Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast."},{"string":"49. And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him."},{"string":"50. And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus and took him."},{"string":"51. And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear."},{"string":"52. Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword."},{"string":"53. Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?"},{"string":"54. But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?"},{"string":"55. In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me."},{"string":"56. But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled."},{"string":"57. And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled."},{"string":"58.

Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;"},{"string":"60. But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,"},{"string":"61. And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days."},{"string":"62. And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?"},{"string":"63. But Jesus held his peace, And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God."},{"string":"64. Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven."},{"string":"65. Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy."},{"string":"66. What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death."},{"string":"67. Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands,"},{"string":"68. Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?"},{"string":"69. Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee."},{"string":"70. But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest."},{"string":"71. And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth."},{"string":"72. And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man."},{"string":"73. And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee."},{"string":"74. Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew."},{"string":"75.

And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself."},{"string":"6. And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood."},{"string":"7. And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in."},{"string":"8. Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day."},{"string":"9. Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;"},{"string":"10.

And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest."},{"string":"12. And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing."},{"string":"13. Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?"},{"string":"14. And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly."},{"string":"15. Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would."},{"string":"16. And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas."},{"string":"17. Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?"},{"string":"18. For he knew that for envy they had delivered him."},{"string":"19. When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him."},{"string":"20. But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus."},{"string":"21. The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas."},{"string":"22. Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified."},{"string":"23. And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified."},{"string":"24. When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye to it."},{"string":"25. Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children."},{"string":"26. Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified."},{"string":"27. Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers."},{"string":"28. And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe."},{"string":"29. And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!"},{"string":"30. And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head."},{"string":"31. And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him."},{"string":"32. And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross."},{"string":"33. And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull,"},{"string":"34. They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink."},{"string":"35. And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots."},{"string":"36. And sitting down they watched him there;"},{"string":"37. And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS."},{"string":"38. Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left."},{"string":"39. And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,"},{"string":"40. And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross."},{"string":"41. Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said,"},{"string":"42. He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him."},{"string":"43. He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God."},{"string":"44. The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth."},{"string":"45. Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour."},{"string":"46. And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"},{"string":"47. Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calleth for Elias."},{"string":"48. And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink."},{"string":"49. The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him."},{"string":"50. Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost."},{"string":"51.

And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,"},{"string":"53. And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many."},{"string":"54. Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God."},{"string":"55.

Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedees children."},{"string":"57. When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple:"},{"string":"58. He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered."},{"string":"59. And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,"},{"string":"60. And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed."},{"string":"61. And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre."},{"string":"62. Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,"},{"string":"63. Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again."},{"string":"64. Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first."},{"string":"65.

His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:"},{"string":"4. And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men."},{"string":"5. And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified."},{"string":"6. He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay."},{"string":"7. And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you."},{"string":"8. And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word."},{"string":"9. And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him."},{"string":"10. Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me."},{"string":"11. Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done."},{"string":"12.

And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them."},{"string":"14. And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom, and said unto him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him."},{"string":"15. And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him."},{"string":"16. And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners?"},{"string":"17. When Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."},{"string":"18. And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and they come and say unto him, Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?"},{"string":"19. And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast."},{"string":"20. But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days."},{"string":"21. No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old, and the rent is made worse."},{"string":"22. And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: else the new wine doth burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles will be marred: but new wine must be put into new bottles."},{"string":"23. And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn."},{"string":"24. And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful?"},{"string":"25. And he said unto them, Have ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with him?"},{"string":"26. How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him?"},{"string":"27. And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath:"},{"string":"28. Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath."}]},{"title":"Mark 3","children":[{"string":"1.

And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath day; that they might accuse him."},{"string":"3. And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand, Stand forth."},{"string":"4. And he saith unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they held their peace."},{"string":"5. And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith unto the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it out: and his hand was restored whole as the other."},{"string":"6. And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him."},{"string":"7. But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea,"},{"string":"8. And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and from beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what great things he did, came unto him."},{"string":"9. And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him."},{"string":"10. For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had plagues."},{"string":"11. And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God."},{"string":"12. And he straitly charged them that they should not make him known."},{"string":"13. And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth unto him whom he would: and they came unto him."},{"string":"14. And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,"},{"string":"15. And to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils:"},{"string":"16.

And when his friends heard of it, they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself."},{"string":"22. And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils."},{"string":"23. And he called them unto him, and said unto them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?"},{"string":"24. And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand."},{"string":"25. And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand."},{"string":"26. And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end."},{"string":"27.

And the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee."},{"string":"33. And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my brethren?"},{"string":"34. And he looked round about on them which sat about him, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!"},{"string":"35.

But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away."},{"string":"7. And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit."},{"string":"8. And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred."},{"string":"9. And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear."},{"string":"10. And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable."},{"string":"11.

That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them."},{"string":"13.

And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts."},{"string":"16. And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;"},{"string":"17. And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake, immediately they are offended."},{"string":"18. And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word,"},{"string":"19. And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful."},{"string":"20. And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred."},{"string":"21. And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?"},{"string":"22. For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad."},{"string":"23. If any man have ears to hear, let him hear."},{"string":"24. And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given."},{"string":"25. For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath."},{"string":"26.

But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come."},{"string":"30. And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?"},{"string":"31. It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:"},{"string":"32.

And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships."},{"string":"37. And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full."},{"string":"38.

And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones."},{"string":"6. But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him,"},{"string":"7. And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not."},{"string":"8. For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit."},{"string":"9. And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are many."},{"string":"10. And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country."},{"string":"11. Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding."},{"string":"12. And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them."},{"string":"13. And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were choked in the sea."},{"string":"14.

Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee."},{"string":"20. And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him: and all men did marvel."},{"string":"21. And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side, much people gathered unto him: and he was nigh unto the sea."},{"string":"22. And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,"},{"string":"23. And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at the point of death: I pray thee, come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be healed; and she shall live."},{"string":"24.

And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague."},{"string":"30. And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who touched my clothes?"},{"string":"31. And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?"},{"string":"32.

While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogue's house certain which said, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the Master any further?"},{"string":"36.

But when he had put them all out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying."},{"string":"41.

Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him."},{"string":"4.

Others said, That it is Elias. And others said, That it is a prophet, or as one of the prophets."},{"string":"16. But when Herod heard thereof, he said, It is John, whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead."},{"string":"17. For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife: for he had married her."},{"string":"18. For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife."},{"string":"19. Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have killed him; but she could not:"},{"string":"20. For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly."},{"string":"21. And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief estates of Galilee;"},{"string":"22.

And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist."},{"string":"26. And the king was exceeding sorry; yet for his oath's sake, and for their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her."},{"string":"27. And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison,"},{"string":"28.

Send them away, that they may go into the country round about, and into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have nothing to eat."},{"string":"37.

And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men."},{"string":"45. And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he sent away the people."},{"string":"46. And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray."},{"string":"47. And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land."},{"string":"48.

And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered."},{"string":"52. For they considered not the miracle of the loaves: for their heart was hardened."},{"string":"53. And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore."},{"string":"54. And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew him,"},{"string":"55. And ran through that whole region round about, and began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was."},{"string":"56. And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole."}]},{"title":"Mark 7","children":[{"string":"1.

For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders."},{"string":"4. And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat not.

Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?"},{"string":"20.

And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury:"},{"string":"44.

And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down."},{"string":"3. And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,"},{"string":"4. Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled?"},{"string":"5. And Jesus answering them began to say, Take heed lest any man deceive you:"},{"string":"6. For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many."},{"string":"7. And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not troubled: for such things must needs be; but the end shall not be yet."},{"string":"8. For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be famines and troubles: these are the beginnings of sorrows."},{"string":"9. But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them."},{"string":"10.

But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost."},{"string":"12. Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father the son; and children shall rise up against their parents, and shall cause them to be put to death."},{"string":"13. And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved."},{"string":"14. But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand,) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains:"},{"string":"15. And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house, neither enter therein, to take any thing out of his house:"},{"string":"16. And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment."},{"string":"17. But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!"},{"string":"18. And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter."},{"string":"19. For in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created unto this time, neither shall be."},{"string":"20. And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should be saved: but for the elect's sake, whom he hath chosen, he hath shortened the days."},{"string":"21. And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ; or, lo, he is there; believe him not:"},{"string":"22. For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect."},{"string":"23. But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things."},{"string":"24. But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,"},{"string":"25.

Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass, till all these things be done."},{"string":"31. Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away."},{"string":"32. But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father."},{"string":"33. Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is."},{"string":"34. For the Son of Man is as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and commanded the porter to watch."},{"string":"35. Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning:"},{"string":"36.

And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious; and she brake the box, and poured it on his head."},{"string":"4.

For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have not always."},{"string":"8. She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying."},{"string":"9. Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her."},{"string":"10.

And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover?"},{"string":"13.

And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover."},{"string":"17. And in the evening he cometh with the twelve."},{"string":"18. And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, One of you which eateth with me shall betray me."},{"string":"19. And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, Is it I? and another said, Is it I?"},{"string":"20. And he answered and said unto them, It is one of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the dish."},{"string":"21. The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had never been born."},{"string":"22. And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body."},{"string":"23. And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them: and they all drank of it."},{"string":"24. And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many."},{"string":"25. Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God."},{"string":"26. And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives."},{"string":"27.

But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee."},{"string":"29. But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet will not I."},{"string":"30. And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice."},{"string":"31. But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all."},{"string":"32. And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray."},{"string":"33. And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy;"},{"string":"34. And saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry ye here, and watch."},{"string":"35.

And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners."},{"string":"42. Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand."},{"string":"43. And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders."},{"string":"44. And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead him away safely."},{"string":"45. And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and saith, Master, master; and kissed him."},{"string":"46. And they laid their hands on him, and took him."},{"string":"47. And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear."},{"string":"48. And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and with staves to take me?"},{"string":"49. I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled."},{"string":"50. And they all forsook him, and fled."},{"string":"51. And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold on him:"},{"string":"52.

And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found none."},{"string":"56. For many bare false witness against him, but their witness agreed not together."},{"string":"57. And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him, saying,"},{"string":"58. We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands."},{"string":"59. But neither so did their witness agree together."},{"string":"60. And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?"},{"string":"61. But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?"},{"string":"62. And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven."},{"string":"63. Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses?"},{"string":"64. Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death."},{"string":"65. And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands."},{"string":"66. And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest:"},{"string":"67. And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth."},{"string":"68. But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew."},{"string":"69. And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is one of them."},{"string":"70. And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art a Galilaean, and thy speech agreeth thereto."},{"string":"71. But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this man of whom ye speak."},{"string":"72. And the second time the cock crew.

And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing."},{"string":"4.

Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired."},{"string":"7.

And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them."},{"string":"9. But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?"},{"string":"10. For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy."},{"string":"11. But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them."},{"string":"12. And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?"},{"string":"13. And they cried out again, Crucify him."},{"string":"14. Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him."},{"string":"15. And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified."},{"string":"16. And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band."},{"string":"17. And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his head,"},{"string":"18. And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!"},{"string":"19. And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him."},{"string":"20. And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him."},{"string":"21. And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross."},{"string":"22. And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull."},{"string":"23. And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not."},{"string":"24. And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take."},{"string":"25. And it was the third hour, and they crucified him."},{"string":"26. And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS."},{"string":"27. And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left."},{"string":"28. And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors."},{"string":"29. And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days,"},{"string":"30. Save thyself, and come down from the cross."},{"string":"31. Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save."},{"string":"32. Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him."},{"string":"33. And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour."},{"string":"34. And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"},{"string":"35. And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elias."},{"string":"36. And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down."},{"string":"37.

And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God."},{"string":"40.

Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus."},{"string":"44.

And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph."},{"string":"46. And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre."},{"string":"47.

And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great."},{"string":"5. And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted."},{"string":"6. And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him."},{"string":"7. But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you."},{"string":"8. And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any man; for they were afraid."},{"string":"9. Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils."},{"string":"10. And she went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept."},{"string":"11. And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, believed not."},{"string":"12. After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they walked, and went into the country."},{"string":"13.

And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God."},{"string":"17. And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord."},{"string":"18. And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years."},{"string":"19. And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings."},{"string":"20. And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season."},{"string":"21. And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple."},{"string":"22. And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless."},{"string":"23.

Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?"},{"string":"35. And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God."},{"string":"36. And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren."},{"string":"37.

Woe unto you that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep."},{"string":"26. Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets."},{"string":"27. But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you,"},{"string":"28. Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you."},{"string":"29. And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also."},{"string":"30. Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again."},{"string":"31. And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise."},{"string":"32. For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for sinners also love those that love them."},{"string":"33. And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye? for sinners also do even the same."},{"string":"34. And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again."},{"string":"35. But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil."},{"string":"36. Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful."},{"string":"37. Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:"},{"string":"38. Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again."},{"string":"39. And he spake a parable unto them, Can the blind lead the blind? shall they not both fall into the ditch?"},{"string":"40. The disciple is not above his master: but every one that is perfect shall be as his master."},{"string":"41. And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye?"},{"string":"42. Either how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's eye."},{"string":"43. For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit."},{"string":"44. For every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes."},{"string":"45. A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh."},{"string":"46. And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?"},{"string":"47. Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will shew you to whom he is like:"},{"string":"48. He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock."},{"string":"49. But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great."}]},{"title":"Luke 7","children":[{"string":"1. Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people, he entered into Capernaum."},{"string":"2. And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear unto him, was sick, and ready to die."},{"string":"3. And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant."},{"string":"4. And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this:"},{"string":"5. For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue."},{"string":"6. Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof:"},{"string":"7. Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed."},{"string":"8. For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it."},{"string":"9. When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel."},{"string":"10. And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick."},{"string":"11. And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people."},{"string":"12. Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her."},{"string":"13. And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not."},{"string":"14. And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise."},{"string":"15. And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother."},{"string":"16. And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people."},{"string":"17. And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the region round about."},{"string":"18. And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things."},{"string":"19. And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?"},{"string":"20. When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?"},{"string":"21. And in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many that were blind he gave sight."},{"string":"22. Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached."},{"string":"23. And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me."},{"string":"24. And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind?"},{"string":"25. But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings' courts."},{"string":"26. But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet."},{"string":"27. This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee."},{"string":"28. For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he."},{"string":"29. And all the people that heard him, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John."},{"string":"30. But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him."},{"string":"31. And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like?"},{"string":"32. They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept."},{"string":"33. For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a devil."},{"string":"34. The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!"},{"string":"35. But wisdom is justified of all her children."},{"string":"36. And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to meat."},{"string":"37. And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,"},{"string":"38. And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment."},{"string":"39. Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him: for she is a sinner."},{"string":"40. And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on."},{"string":"41. There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty."},{"string":"42. And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?"},{"string":"43. Simon answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged."},{"string":"44. And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head."},{"string":"45. Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet."},{"string":"46. My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment."},{"string":"47. Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little."},{"string":"48. And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven."},{"string":"49. And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?"},{"string":"50. And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace."}]},{"title":"Luke 8","children":[{"string":"1. And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and village, preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve were with him,"},{"string":"2. And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils,"},{"string":"3. And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, which ministered unto him of their substance."},{"string":"4. And when much people were gathered together, and were come to him out of every city, he spake by a parable:"},{"string":"5. A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it."},{"string":"6. And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture."},{"string":"7. And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it."},{"string":"8. And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an hundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear."},{"string":"9. And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be?"},{"string":"10. And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand."},{"string":"11. Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God."},{"string":"12. Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved."},{"string":"13. They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away."},{"string":"14. And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection."},{"string":"15. But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience."},{"string":"16. No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light."},{"string":"17. For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither any thing hid, that shall not be known and come abroad."},{"string":"18. Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have."},{"string":"19. Then came to him his mother and his brethren, and could not come at him for the press."},{"string":"20. And it was told him by certain which said, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee."},{"string":"21. And he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God, and do it."},{"string":"22. Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship with his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other side of the lake. And they launched forth."},{"string":"23. But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filled with water, and were in jeopardy."},{"string":"24. And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm."},{"string":"25. And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him."},{"string":"26. And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee."},{"string":"27. And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, neither abode in any house, but in the tombs."},{"string":"28. When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not."},{"string":"29. (For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was driven of the devil into the wilderness.)"},{"string":"30. And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion: because many devils were entered into him."},{"string":"31. And they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep."},{"string":"32. And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them. And he suffered them."},{"string":"33. Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were choked."},{"string":"34. When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went and told it in the city and in the country."},{"string":"35. Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid."},{"string":"36. They also which saw it told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed."},{"string":"37. Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear: and he went up into the ship, and returned back again."},{"string":"38. Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying,"},{"string":"39. Return to thine own house, and shew how great things God hath done unto thee. And he went his way, and published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him."},{"string":"40. And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people gladly received him: for they were all waiting for him."},{"string":"41. And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and besought him that he would come into his house:"},{"string":"42. For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him."},{"string":"43. And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any,"},{"string":"44. Came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately her issue of blood stanched."},{"string":"45. And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?"},{"string":"46. And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me."},{"string":"47. And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately."},{"string":"48. And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace."},{"string":"49. While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue's house, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Master."},{"string":"50. But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Fear not: believe only, and she shall be made whole."},{"string":"51. And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in, save Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the maiden."},{"string":"52. And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth."},{"string":"53. And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead."},{"string":"54. And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, saying, Maid, arise."},{"string":"55. And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and he commanded to give her meat."},{"string":"56. And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done."}]},{"title":"Luke 9","children":[{"string":"1. Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases."},{"string":"2.

And whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide, and thence depart."},{"string":"5. And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them."},{"string":"6. And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the gospel, and healing every where."},{"string":"7. Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and he was perplexed, because that it was said of some, that John was risen from the dead;"},{"string":"8. And of some, that Elias had appeared; and of others, that one of the old prophets was risen again."},{"string":"9. And Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom I hear such things?

And he took them, and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida."},{"string":"11. And the people, when they knew it, followed him: and he received them, and spake unto them of the kingdom of God, and healed them that had need of healing."},{"string":"12. And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the towns and country round about, and lodge, and get victuals: for we are here in a desert place."},{"string":"13. But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy meat for all this people."},{"string":"14. For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them sit down by fifties in a company."},{"string":"15. And they did so, and made them all sit down."},{"string":"16. Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude."},{"string":"17. And they did eat, and were all filled: and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets."},{"string":"18. And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people that I am?"},{"string":"19. They answering said, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and others say, that one of the old prophets is risen again."},{"string":"20. He said unto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answering said, The Christ of God."},{"string":"21. And he straitly charged them, and commanded them to tell no man that thing;"},{"string":"22. Saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain, and be raised the third day."},{"string":"23. And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me."},{"string":"24. For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it."},{"string":"25. For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away?"},{"string":"26. For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy angels."},{"string":"27. But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God."},{"string":"28. And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray."},{"string":"29. And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering."},{"string":"30. And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and Elias:"},{"string":"31. Who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem."},{"string":"32. But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him."},{"string":"33. And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he said."},{"string":"34. While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud."},{"string":"35. And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him."},{"string":"36. And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept it close, and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen."},{"string":"37. And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come down from the hill, much people met him."},{"string":"38. And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee, look upon my son: for he is mine only child."},{"string":"39. And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth again, and bruising him hardly departeth from him."},{"string":"40. And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could not."},{"string":"41. And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy son hither."},{"string":"42. And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare him.

But while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said unto his disciples,"},{"string":"44. Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men."},{"string":"45. But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that saying."},{"string":"46. Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be greatest."},{"string":"47. And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child, and set him by him,"},{"string":"48. And said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same shall be great."},{"string":"49. And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us."},{"string":"50.

But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father."},{"string":"60. Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God."},{"string":"61. And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house."},{"string":"62.

Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you."},{"string":"20. Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven."},{"string":"21. In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight."},{"string":"22. All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knoweth who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him."},{"string":"23. And he turned him unto his disciples, and said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see:"},{"string":"24. For I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them."},{"string":"25. And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"},{"string":"26. He said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou?"},{"string":"27. And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself."},{"string":"28. And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live."},{"string":"29. But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour?"},{"string":"30. And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead."},{"string":"31. And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side."},{"string":"32. And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other side."},{"string":"33. But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him,"},{"string":"34. And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him."},{"string":"35. And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee."},{"string":"36. Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves?"},{"string":"37. And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise."},{"string":"38. Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house."},{"string":"39. And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus' feet, and heard his word."},{"string":"40. But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me."},{"string":"41. And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things:"},{"string":"42. But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her."}]},{"title":"Luke 11","children":[{"string":"1. And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples."},{"string":"2. And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth."},{"string":"3. Give us day by day our daily bread."},{"string":"4. And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil."},{"string":"5. And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves;"},{"string":"6. For a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have nothing to set before him?"},{"string":"7. And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee."},{"string":"8. I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth."},{"string":"9. And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you."},{"string":"10. For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened."},{"string":"11. If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent?"},{"string":"12. Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion?"},{"string":"13. If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?"},{"string":"14. And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it came to pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb spake; and the people wondered."},{"string":"15. But some of them said, He casteth out devils through Beelzebub the chief of the devils."},{"string":"16. And others, tempting him, sought of him a sign from heaven."},{"string":"17. But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house divided against a house falleth."},{"string":"18. If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub."},{"string":"19. And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges."},{"string":"20. But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you."},{"string":"21. When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace:"},{"string":"22. But when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoils."},{"string":"23. He that is not with me is against me: and he that gathereth not with me scattereth."},{"string":"24. When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, I will return unto my house whence I came out."},{"string":"25.

Then goeth he, and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first."},{"string":"27. And it came to pass, as he spake these things, a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked."},{"string":"28. But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it."},{"string":"29. And when the people were gathered thick together, he began to say, This is an evil generation: they seek a sign; and there shall no sign be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet."},{"string":"30. For as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of man be to this generation."},{"string":"31. The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and condemn them: for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here."},{"string":"32.

No man, when he hath lighted a candle, putteth it in a secret place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they which come in may see the light."},{"string":"34. The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when thine eye is evil, thy body also is full of darkness."},{"string":"35. Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness."},{"string":"36. If thy whole body therefore be full of light, having no part dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light."},{"string":"37.

And the Lord said unto him, Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness."},{"string":"40. Ye fools, did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also?"},{"string":"41. But rather give alms of such things as ye have; and, behold, all things are clean unto you."},{"string":"42. But woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone."},{"string":"43. Woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets."},{"string":"44. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as graves which appear not, and the men that walk over them are not aware of them."},{"string":"45. Then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, Master, thus saying thou reproachest us also."},{"string":"46. And he said, Woe unto you also, ye lawyers! for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers."},{"string":"47. Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and your fathers killed them."},{"string":"48. Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers: for they indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulchres."},{"string":"49. Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they shall slay and persecute:"},{"string":"50. That the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;"},{"string":"51. From the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias which perished between the altar and the temple: verily I say unto you, It shall be required of this generation."},{"string":"52. Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered."},{"string":"53. And as he said these things unto them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to urge him vehemently, and to provoke him to speak of many things:"},{"string":"54. Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of his mouth, that they might accuse him."}]},{"title":"Luke 12","children":[{"string":"1. In the mean time, when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people, insomuch that they trode one upon another, he began to say unto his disciples first of all, Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy."},{"string":"2. For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid, that shall not be known."},{"string":"3. Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops."},{"string":"4. And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do."},{"string":"5. But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him."},{"string":"6. Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God?"},{"string":"7. But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows."},{"string":"8. Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God:"},{"string":"9. But he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of God."},{"string":"10.

And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth."},{"string":"16. And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:"},{"string":"17. And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?"},{"string":"18. And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods."},{"string":"19. And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry."},{"string":"20. But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided?"},{"string":"21. So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God."},{"string":"22. And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the body, what ye shall put on."},{"string":"23. The life is more than meat, and the body is more than raiment."},{"string":"24.

Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them."},{"string":"38.

Then Peter said unto him, Lord, speakest thou this parable unto us, or even to all?"},{"string":"42.

I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance."},{"string":"8. Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one piece, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently till she find it?"},{"string":"9. And when she hath found it, she calleth her friends and her neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with me; for I have found the piece which I had lost."},{"string":"10. Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth."},{"string":"11. And he said, A certain man had two sons:"},{"string":"12. And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his living."},{"string":"13. And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living."},{"string":"14. And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want."},{"string":"15. And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine."},{"string":"16. And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him."},{"string":"17. And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!"},{"string":"18. I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,"},{"string":"19. And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants."},{"string":"20. And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him."},{"string":"21. And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son."},{"string":"22. But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet:"},{"string":"23. And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry:"},{"string":"24. For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry."},{"string":"25. Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard musick and dancing."},{"string":"26. And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant."},{"string":"27. And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound."},{"string":"28. And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father out, and intreated him."},{"string":"29. And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:"},{"string":"30. But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf."},{"string":"31. And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine."},{"string":"32. It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found."}]},{"title":"Luke 16","children":[{"string":"1. And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods."},{"string":"2. And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward."},{"string":"3. Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed."},{"string":"4. I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses."},{"string":"5. So he called every one of his lord's debtors unto him, and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?"},{"string":"6. And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty."},{"string":"7. Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore."},{"string":"8. And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light."},{"string":"9. And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations."},{"string":"10. He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much."},{"string":"11. If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?"},{"string":"12. And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own?"},{"string":"13. No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon."},{"string":"14. And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him."},{"string":"15. And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God."},{"string":"16. The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it."},{"string":"17. And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail."},{"string":"18. Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adultery."},{"string":"19. There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:"},{"string":"20. And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,"},{"string":"21. And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores."},{"string":"22. And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;"},{"string":"23. And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom."},{"string":"24. And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame."},{"string":"25. But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented."},{"string":"26. And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence."},{"string":"27.

Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them."},{"string":"30.

And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him."},{"string":"5.

Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you."},{"string":"22. And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see it."},{"string":"23. And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after them, nor follow them."},{"string":"24. For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven, shineth unto the other part under heaven; so shall also the Son of man be in his day."},{"string":"25.

Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed."},{"string":"31.

And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich."},{"string":"24. And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!"},{"string":"25.

Then began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and went into a far country for a long time."},{"string":"10. And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat him, and sent him away empty."},{"string":"11. And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and entreated him shamefully, and sent him away empty."},{"string":"12. And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast him out."},{"string":"13. Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: it may be they will reverence him when they see him."},{"string":"14. But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours."},{"string":"15. So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them?"},{"string":"16. He shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give the vineyard to others. And when they heard it, they said, God forbid."},{"string":"17. And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?"},{"string":"18. Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder."},{"string":"19. And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them."},{"string":"20. And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should feign themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor."},{"string":"21. And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person of any, but teachest the way of God truly:"},{"string":"22. Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or no?"},{"string":"23. But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why tempt ye me?"},{"string":"24. Shew me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it? They answered and said, Caesar's."},{"string":"25. And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's, and unto God the things which be God's."},{"string":"26.

Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for seven had her to wife."},{"string":"34. And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage:"},{"string":"35. But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:"},{"string":"36. Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection."},{"string":"37. Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob."},{"string":"38. For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him."},{"string":"39. Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast well said."},{"string":"40.

But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?"},{"string":"41. And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss."},{"string":"42. And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom."},{"string":"43.

It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, which told these things unto the apostles."},{"string":"11.

But their eyes were holden that they should not know him."},{"string":"17. And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?"},{"string":"18. And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?"},{"string":"19.

Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre;"},{"string":"23. And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive."},{"string":"24. And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not."},{"string":"25. Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:"},{"string":"26. Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?"},{"string":"27. And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself."},{"string":"28. And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further."},{"string":"29. But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them."},{"string":"30. And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them."},{"string":"31. And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight."},{"string":"32. And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?"},{"string":"33.

Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon."},{"string":"35. And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread."},{"string":"36. And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you."},{"string":"37. But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit."},{"string":"38. And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?"},{"string":"39. Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have."},{"string":"40. And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet."},{"string":"41. And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat?"},{"string":"42. And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb."},{"string":"43. And he took it, and did eat before them."},{"string":"44. And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me."},{"string":"45.

The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world."},{"string":"30. This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me."},{"string":"31. And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water."},{"string":"32. And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him."},{"string":"33. And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost."},{"string":"34. And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God."},{"string":"35. Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;"},{"string":"36. And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!"},{"string":"37. And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus."},{"string":"38. Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?"},{"string":"39. He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour."},{"string":"40. One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother."},{"string":"41. He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ."},{"string":"42. And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone."},{"string":"43. The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me."},{"string":"44. Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter."},{"string":"45. Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."},{"string":"46. And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see."},{"string":"47. Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!"},{"string":"48. Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee."},{"string":"49. Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel."},{"string":"50. Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these."},{"string":"51. And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man."}]},{"title":"John 2","children":[{"string":"1. And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:"},{"string":"2. And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage."},{"string":"3. And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine."},{"string":"4. Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come."},{"string":"5. His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it."},{"string":"6. And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece."},{"string":"7. Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim."},{"string":"8. And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it."},{"string":"9. When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,"},{"string":"10. And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now."},{"string":"11. This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him."},{"string":"12. After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days."},{"string":"13. And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem."},{"string":"14. And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:"},{"string":"15. And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables;"},{"string":"16. And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise."},{"string":"17. And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up."},{"string":"18. Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?"},{"string":"19. Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up."},{"string":"20. Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?"},{"string":"21. But he spake of the temple of his body."},{"string":"22. When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said."},{"string":"23. Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did."},{"string":"24. But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men,"},{"string":"25. And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man."}]},{"title":"John 3","children":[{"string":"1. There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:"},{"string":"2.

Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God."},{"string":"4. Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?"},{"string":"5. Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God."},{"string":"6. That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit."},{"string":"7. Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again."},{"string":"8.

If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?"},{"string":"13. And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven."},{"string":"14. And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:"},{"string":"15. That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life."},{"string":"16. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."},{"string":"17. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved."},{"string":"18. He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God."},{"string":"19. And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil."},{"string":"20. For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved."},{"string":"21. But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God."},{"string":"22. After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized."},{"string":"23. And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized."},{"string":"24. For John was not yet cast into prison."},{"string":"25.

For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him."},{"string":"35. The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand."},{"string":"36.

When therefore the LORD knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,"},{"string":"2. (Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)"},{"string":"3. He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee."},{"string":"4. And he must needs go through Samaria."},{"string":"5. Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph."},{"string":"6. Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour."},{"string":"7. There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink."},{"string":"8. (For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)"},{"string":"9. Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans."},{"string":"10. Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water."},{"string":"11. The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?"},{"string":"12. Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?"},{"string":"13. Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:"},{"string":"14. But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life."},{"string":"15. The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw."},{"string":"16. Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither."},{"string":"17. The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:"},{"string":"18. For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly."},{"string":"19. The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet."},{"string":"20. Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship."},{"string":"21. Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father."},{"string":"22. Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews."},{"string":"23. But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him."},{"string":"24. God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth."},{"string":"25. The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things."},{"string":"26. Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he."},{"string":"27. And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?"},{"string":"28. The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,"},{"string":"29. Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?"},{"string":"30. Then they went out of the city, and came unto him."},{"string":"31. In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat."},{"string":"32. But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of."},{"string":"33. Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought to eat?"},{"string":"34. Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work."},{"string":"35. Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest."},{"string":"36. And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together."},{"string":"37. And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth."},{"string":"38. I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours."},{"string":"39. And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did."},{"string":"40. So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days."},{"string":"41. And many more believed because of his own word;"},{"string":"42. And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world."},{"string":"43. Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee."},{"string":"44. For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country."},{"string":"45. Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast."},{"string":"46. So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum."},{"string":"47. When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death."},{"string":"48. Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe."},{"string":"49. The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die."},{"string":"50. Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way."},{"string":"51. And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Thy son liveth."},{"string":"52. Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him."},{"string":"53. So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house."},{"string":"54. This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee."}]},{"title":"John 5","children":[{"string":"1. After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem."},{"string":"2. Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches."},{"string":"3. In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water."},{"string":"4. For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had."},{"string":"5. And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years."},{"string":"6. When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?"},{"string":"7. The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me."},{"string":"8. Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk."},{"string":"9. And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath."},{"string":"10. The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed."},{"string":"11. He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk."},{"string":"12. Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?"},{"string":"13. And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place."},{"string":"14. Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee."},{"string":"15. The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole."},{"string":"16. And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day."},{"string":"17. But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work."},{"string":"18. Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God."},{"string":"19. Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise."},{"string":"20. For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel."},{"string":"21. For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will."},{"string":"22. For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son:"},{"string":"23. That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him."},{"string":"24. Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life."},{"string":"25. Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live."},{"string":"26. For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;"},{"string":"27.

Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,"},{"string":"29. And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation."},{"string":"30. I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me."},{"string":"31. If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true."},{"string":"32. There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true."},{"string":"33.

He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light."},{"string":"36. But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me."},{"string":"37. And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape."},{"string":"38.

When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come unto him, he saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?"},{"string":"6. And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do."},{"string":"7. Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little."},{"string":"8. One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith unto him,"},{"string":"9. There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many?"},{"string":"10. And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand."},{"string":"11. And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would."},{"string":"12. When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost."},{"string":"13. Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten."},{"string":"14. Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world."},{"string":"15. When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone."},{"string":"16. And when even was now come, his disciples went down unto the sea,"},{"string":"17. And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them."},{"string":"18. And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew."},{"string":"19.

When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus."},{"string":"25. And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?"},{"string":"26. Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled."},{"string":"27.

They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work?"},{"string":"31. Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat."},{"string":"32.

For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world."},{"string":"34. Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread."},{"string":"35. And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst."},{"string":"36. But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not."},{"string":"37.

For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me."},{"string":"39. And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day."},{"string":"40.

The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?"},{"string":"53. Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you."},{"string":"54. Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day."},{"string":"55. For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed."},{"string":"56. He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him."},{"string":"57. As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me."},{"string":"58. This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever."},{"string":"59. These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum."},{"string":"60. Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?"},{"string":"61. When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, Doth this offend you?"},{"string":"62. What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?"},{"string":"63. It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life."},{"string":"64. But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him."},{"string":"65. And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father."},{"string":"66. From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him."},{"string":"67. Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away?"},{"string":"68. Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life."},{"string":"69. And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God."},{"string":"70. Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?"},{"string":"71. He spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve."}]},{"title":"John 7","children":[{"string":"1. After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him."},{"string":"2. Now the Jew's feast of tabernacles was at hand."},{"string":"3. His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest."},{"string":"4. For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world."},{"string":"5. For neither did his brethren believe in him."},{"string":"6. Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready."},{"string":"7. The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil."},{"string":"8. Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast: for my time is not yet full come."},{"string":"9. When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in Galilee."},{"string":"10. But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret."},{"string":"11. Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?"},{"string":"12. And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people."},{"string":"13. Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews."},{"string":"14. Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught."},{"string":"15. And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?"},{"string":"16. Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me."},{"string":"17. If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself."},{"string":"18. He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him."},{"string":"19. Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me?"},{"string":"20. The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee?"},{"string":"21. Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel."},{"string":"22. Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man."},{"string":"23.

Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment."},{"string":"25. Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?"},{"string":"26. But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?"},{"string":"27. Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is."},{"string":"28. Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not."},{"string":"29.

The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him."},{"string":"33. Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto him that sent me."},{"string":"34. Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come."},{"string":"35. Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?"},{"string":"36. What manner of saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come?"},{"string":"37. In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink."},{"string":"38. He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water."},{"string":"39. (But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)"},{"string":"40. Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet."},{"string":"41. Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?"},{"string":"42. Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?"},{"string":"43. So there was a division among the people because of him."},{"string":"44. And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him."},{"string":"45. Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?"},{"string":"46. The officers answered, Never man spake like this man."},{"string":"47. Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?"},{"string":"48.

And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,"},{"string":"4. They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act."},{"string":"5. Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?"},{"string":"6. This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not."},{"string":"7. So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her."},{"string":"8. And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground."},{"string":"9. And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst."},{"string":"10. When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?"},{"string":"11. She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more."},{"string":"12. Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life."},{"string":"13. The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true."},{"string":"14. Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go."},{"string":"15. Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man."},{"string":"16. And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me."},{"string":"17. It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true."},{"string":"18. I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me."},{"string":"19. Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also."},{"string":"20. These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come."},{"string":"21. Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come."},{"string":"22. Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come."},{"string":"23. And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world."},{"string":"24. I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins."},{"string":"25. Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning."},{"string":"26. I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him."},{"string":"27.

And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him."},{"string":"30. As he spake these words, many believed on him."},{"string":"31.

And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free."},{"string":"33. They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?"},{"string":"34. Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin."},{"string":"35. And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son abideth ever."},{"string":"36. If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed."},{"string":"37. I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you."},{"string":"38. I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father."},{"string":"39. They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham."},{"string":"40. But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham."},{"string":"41. Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God."},{"string":"42. Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me."},{"string":"43. Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word."},{"string":"44. Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it."},{"string":"45. And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not."},{"string":"46. Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?"},{"string":"47. He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God."},{"string":"48. Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?"},{"string":"49. Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me."},{"string":"50. And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth."},{"string":"51. Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death."},{"string":"52. Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil.

Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?"},{"string":"54. Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:"},{"string":"55. Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying."},{"string":"56. Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad."},{"string":"57. Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?"},{"string":"58. Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am."},{"string":"59.

And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing."},{"string":"8. The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?"},{"string":"9. Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am he."},{"string":"10. Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?"},{"string":"11.

Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not."},{"string":"13. They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind."},{"string":"14.

But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself."},{"string":"22. These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue."},{"string":"23. Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him."},{"string":"24. Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner."},{"string":"25. He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see."},{"string":"26.

We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know not from whence he is."},{"string":"30. The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes."},{"string":"31.

And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him."},{"string":"39. And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind."},{"string":"40.

And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee."},{"string":"29. As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him."},{"string":"30. Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him."},{"string":"31. The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there."},{"string":"32. Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died."},{"string":"33. When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled."},{"string":"34. And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come and see."},{"string":"35. Jesus wept."},{"string":"36. Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!"},{"string":"37. And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?"},{"string":"38. Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it."},{"string":"39. Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead four days."},{"string":"40. Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?"},{"string":"41. Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me."},{"string":"42. And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me."},{"string":"43. And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth."},{"string":"44. And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go."},{"string":"45. Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him."},{"string":"46. But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done."},{"string":"47. Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles."},{"string":"48. If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation."},{"string":"49. And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,"},{"string":"50. Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not."},{"string":"51. And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;"},{"string":"52. And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad."},{"string":"53. Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death."},{"string":"54. Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples."},{"string":"55. And the Jews' passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves."},{"string":"56. Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast?"},{"string":"57. Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew it, that they might take him."}]},{"title":"John 12","children":[{"string":"1. Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead."},{"string":"2. There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him."},{"string":"3. Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment."},{"string":"4. Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, which should betray him,"},{"string":"5. Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?"},{"string":"6. This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein."},{"string":"7. Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this."},{"string":"8. For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always."},{"string":"9. Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead."},{"string":"10. But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death;"},{"string":"11. Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus."},{"string":"12. On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,"},{"string":"13. Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord."},{"string":"14. And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,"},{"string":"15. Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt."},{"string":"16. These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him."},{"string":"17. The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record."},{"string":"18. For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle."},{"string":"19. The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him."},{"string":"20. And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast:"},{"string":"21. The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus."},{"string":"22. Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus."},{"string":"23. And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified."},{"string":"24. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit."},{"string":"25. He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal."},{"string":"26. If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour."},{"string":"27. Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour."},{"string":"28. Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again."},{"string":"29. The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him."},{"string":"30. Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes."},{"string":"31. Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out."},{"string":"32. And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me."},{"string":"33. This he said, signifying what death he should die."},{"string":"34. The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?"},{"string":"35. Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth."},{"string":"36. While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them."},{"string":"37. But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:"},{"string":"38. That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?"},{"string":"39. Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again,"},{"string":"40. He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them."},{"string":"41. These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him."},{"string":"42. Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:"},{"string":"43. For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God."},{"string":"44. Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me."},{"string":"45. And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me."},{"string":"46. I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness."},{"string":"47. And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world."},{"string":"48. He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day."},{"string":"49. For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak."},{"string":"50. And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak."}]},{"title":"John 13","children":[{"string":"1.

Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God;"},{"string":"4. He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself."},{"string":"5. After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded."},{"string":"6. Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?"},{"string":"7. Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter."},{"string":"8. Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me."},{"string":"9. Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head."},{"string":"10. Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all."},{"string":"11. For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean."},{"string":"12. So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you?"},{"string":"13. Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am."},{"string":"14. If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet."},{"string":"15.

Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake."},{"string":"23. Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved."},{"string":"24. Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake."},{"string":"25. He then lying on Jesus' breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it?"},{"string":"26. Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon."},{"string":"27. And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him, That thou doest, do quickly."},{"string":"28. Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him."},{"string":"29.

I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world."},{"string":"15.

Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;"},{"string":"21.

Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world."},{"string":"25. O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me."},{"string":"26.

Judas then, having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons."},{"string":"4. Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye?"},{"string":"5. They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them."},{"string":"6. As soon then as he had said unto them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground."},{"string":"7. Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth."},{"string":"8.

That the saying might be fulfilled, which he spake, Of them which thou gavest me have I lost none."},{"string":"10. Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus."},{"string":"11. Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?"},{"string":"12. Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him,"},{"string":"13. And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year."},{"string":"14. Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people."},{"string":"15. And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple: that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest."},{"string":"16. But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter."},{"string":"17. Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not thou also one of this man's disciples? He saith, I am not."},{"string":"18. And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself."},{"string":"19. The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine."},{"string":"20. Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing."},{"string":"21. Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said."},{"string":"22. And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so?"},{"string":"23. Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?"},{"string":"24. Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest."},{"string":"25. And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied it, and said, I am not."},{"string":"26. One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?"},{"string":"27. Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew."},{"string":"28. Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover."},{"string":"29. Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man?"},{"string":"30. They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee."},{"string":"31. Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:"},{"string":"32. That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die."},{"string":"33. Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?"},{"string":"34. Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me?"},{"string":"35. Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?"},{"string":"36. Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence."},{"string":"37. Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice."},{"string":"38. Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault at all."},{"string":"39. But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews?"},{"string":"40. Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber."}]},{"title":"John 19","children":[{"string":"1. Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him."},{"string":"2. And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple robe,"},{"string":"3. And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with their hands."},{"string":"4. Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him."},{"string":"5. Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate saith unto them, Behold the man!"},{"string":"6. When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Take ye him, and crucify him: for I find no fault in him."},{"string":"7. The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God."},{"string":"8. When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;"},{"string":"9. And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer."},{"string":"10. Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee?"},{"string":"11. Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin."},{"string":"12. And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar's friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar."},{"string":"13. When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha."},{"string":"14. And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your King!"},{"string":"15. But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar."},{"string":"16. Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away."},{"string":"17. And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha:"},{"string":"18. Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst."},{"string":"19. And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS."},{"string":"20. This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin."},{"string":"21. Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews."},{"string":"22. Pilate answered, What I have written I have written."},{"string":"23. Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout."},{"string":"24. They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did."},{"string":"25. Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene."},{"string":"26. When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!"},{"string":"27. Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home."},{"string":"28. After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst."},{"string":"29. Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a spunge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth."},{"string":"30. When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost."},{"string":"31. The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away."},{"string":"32. Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him."},{"string":"33. But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:"},{"string":"34. But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water."},{"string":"35. And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe."},{"string":"36. For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken."},{"string":"37. And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced."},{"string":"38. And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus."},{"string":"39. And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight."},{"string":"40. Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury."},{"string":"41. Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid."},{"string":"42. There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews' preparation day; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand."}]},{"title":"John 20","children":[{"string":"1.

Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre."},{"string":"4. So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre."},{"string":"5. And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in."},{"string":"6. Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie,"},{"string":"7.

Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed."},{"string":"9. For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead."},{"string":"10. Then the disciples went away again unto their own home."},{"string":"11. But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre,"},{"string":"12.

And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus."},{"string":"15. Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away."},{"string":"16. Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master."},{"string":"17. Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God."},{"string":"18. Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the LORD, and that he had spoken these things unto her."},{"string":"19. Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you."},{"string":"20. And when he had so said, he shewed unto them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the LORD."},{"string":"21. Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you."},{"string":"22. And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost:"},{"string":"23. Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained."},{"string":"24.

But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus."},{"string":"5. Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They answered him, No."},{"string":"6. And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find.

For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,"},{"string":"35. Until I make thy foes thy footstool."},{"string":"36. Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made the same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ."},{"string":"37. Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?"},{"string":"38. Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost."},{"string":"39. For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the LORD our God shall call."},{"string":"40. And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation."},{"string":"41. Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls."},{"string":"42. And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers."},{"string":"43. And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles."},{"string":"44. And all that believed were together, and had all things common;"},{"string":"45. And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need."},{"string":"46. And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,"},{"string":"47. Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved."}]},{"title":"Acts 3","children":[{"string":"1. Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour."},{"string":"2. And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;"},{"string":"3. Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms."},{"string":"4. And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us."},{"string":"5. And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them."},{"string":"6. Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk."},{"string":"7. And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength."},{"string":"8. And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God."},{"string":"9. And all the people saw him walking and praising God:"},{"string":"10. And they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him."},{"string":"11. And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering."},{"string":"12. And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk?"},{"string":"13. The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus; whom ye delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let him go."},{"string":"14. But ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto you;"},{"string":"15. And killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses."},{"string":"16. And his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all."},{"string":"17. And now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers."},{"string":"18. But those things, which God before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled."},{"string":"19. Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord."},{"string":"20. And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you:"},{"string":"21. Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began."},{"string":"22. For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you."},{"string":"23. And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people."},{"string":"24. Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days."},{"string":"25. Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed."},{"string":"26.

Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead."},{"string":"3. And they laid hands on them, and put them in hold unto the next day: for it was now eventide."},{"string":"4. Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand."},{"string":"5. And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes,"},{"string":"6. And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem."},{"string":"7. And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this?"},{"string":"8. Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,"},{"string":"9. If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole;"},{"string":"10. Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole."},{"string":"11. This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner."},{"string":"12. Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved."},{"string":"13. Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus."},{"string":"14. And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it."},{"string":"15. But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,"},{"string":"16. Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it."},{"string":"17. But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name."},{"string":"18. And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus."},{"string":"19. But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye."},{"string":"20. For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard."},{"string":"21. So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all men glorified God for that which was done."},{"string":"22. For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was shewed."},{"string":"23. And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them."},{"string":"24. And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou art God, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:"},{"string":"25. Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?"},{"string":"26. The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ."},{"string":"27. For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together,"},{"string":"28. For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done."},{"string":"29. And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word,"},{"string":"30. By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus."},{"string":"31. And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness."},{"string":"32. And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common."},{"string":"33. And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all."},{"string":"34. Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,"},{"string":"35. And laid them down at the apostles' feet: and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need."},{"string":"36. And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, and of the country of Cyprus,"},{"string":"37. Having land, sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at the apostles' feet."}]},{"title":"Acts 5","children":[{"string":"1. But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession,"},{"string":"2. And kept back part of the price, his wife also being privy to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles' feet."},{"string":"3. But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land?"},{"string":"4. Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart? thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God."},{"string":"5. And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost: and great fear came on all them that heard these things."},{"string":"6. And the young men arose, wound him up, and carried him out, and buried him."},{"string":"7. And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in."},{"string":"8. And Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much? And she said, Yea, for so much."},{"string":"9. Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door, and shall carry thee out."},{"string":"10. Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the ghost: and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying her forth, buried her by her husband."},{"string":"11. And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard these things."},{"string":"12. And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people; (and they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch."},{"string":"13. And of the rest durst no man join himself to them: but the people magnified them."},{"string":"14. And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women.)"},{"string":"15. Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them."},{"string":"16. There came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them which were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one."},{"string":"17. Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with indignation,"},{"string":"18. And laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison."},{"string":"19. But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said,"},{"string":"20. Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life."},{"string":"21. And when they heard that, they entered into the temple early in the morning, and taught. But the high priest came, and they that were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought."},{"string":"22. But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison, they returned and told,"},{"string":"23. Saying, The prison truly found we shut with all safety, and the keepers standing without before the doors: but when we had opened, we found no man within."},{"string":"24. Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things, they doubted of them whereunto this would grow."},{"string":"25. Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people."},{"string":"26. Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without violence: for they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned."},{"string":"27. And when they had brought them, they set them before the council: and the high priest asked them,"},{"string":"28. Saying, Did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name? and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this man's blood upon us."},{"string":"29. Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men."},{"string":"30. The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree."},{"string":"31. Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins."},{"string":"32. And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him."},{"string":"33. When they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took counsel to slay them."},{"string":"34. Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space;"},{"string":"35. And said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men."},{"string":"36. For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nought."},{"string":"37. After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed."},{"string":"38. And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought:"},{"string":"39. But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found even to fight against God."},{"string":"40. And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles, and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go."},{"string":"41. And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name."},{"string":"42. And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ."}]},{"title":"Acts 6","children":[{"string":"1. And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration."},{"string":"2.

Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business."},{"string":"4. But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word."},{"string":"5. And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:"},{"string":"6. Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them."},{"string":"7. And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith."},{"string":"8. And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people."},{"string":"9. Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called the synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen."},{"string":"10. And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake."},{"string":"11. Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and against God."},{"string":"12. And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and caught him, and brought him to the council,"},{"string":"13. And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law:"},{"string":"14. For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us."},{"string":"15. And all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel."}]},{"title":"Acts 7","children":[{"string":"1. Then said the high priest, Are these things so?"},{"string":"2. And he said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran,"},{"string":"3. And said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall shew thee."},{"string":"4. Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in Charran: and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell."},{"string":"5. And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on: yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child."},{"string":"6. And God spake on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat them evil four hundred years."},{"string":"7. And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge, said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place."},{"string":"8. And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so Abraham begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat the twelve patriarchs."},{"string":"9. And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him,"},{"string":"10. And delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house."},{"string":"11. Now there came a dearth over all the land of Egypt and Chanaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance."},{"string":"12. But when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt, he sent out our fathers first."},{"string":"13. And at the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren; and Joseph's kindred was made known unto Pharaoh."},{"string":"14. Then sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to him, and all his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls."},{"string":"15. So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers,"},{"string":"16. And were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of Sychem."},{"string":"17. But when the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,"},{"string":"18. Till another king arose, which knew not Joseph."},{"string":"19. The same dealt subtilly with our kindred, and evil entreated our fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to the end they might not live."},{"string":"20. In which time Moses was born, and was exceeding fair, and nourished up in his father's house three months:"},{"string":"21. And when he was cast out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own son."},{"string":"22. And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds."},{"string":"23. And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel."},{"string":"24. And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him that was oppressed, and smote the Egyptian:"},{"string":"25. For he supposed his brethren would have understood how that God by his hand would deliver them: but they understood not."},{"string":"26. And the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye wrong one to another?"},{"string":"27. But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us?"},{"string":"28. Wilt thou kill me, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday?"},{"string":"29. Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of Madian, where he begat two sons."},{"string":"30. And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sina an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush."},{"string":"31. When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near to behold it, the voice of the LORD came unto him,"},{"string":"32. Saying, I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Then Moses trembled, and durst not behold."},{"string":"33. Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet: for the place where thou standest is holy ground."},{"string":"34. I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send thee into Egypt."},{"string":"35. This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge? the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush."},{"string":"36. He brought them out, after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty years."},{"string":"37. This is that Moses, which said unto the children of Israel, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear."},{"string":"38. This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount Sina, and with our fathers: who received the lively oracles to give unto us:"},{"string":"39. To whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust him from them, and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt,"},{"string":"40. Saying unto Aaron, Make us gods to go before us: for as for this Moses, which brought us out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him."},{"string":"41. And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands."},{"string":"42. Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O ye house of Israel, have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderness?"},{"string":"43. Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon."},{"string":"44. Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking unto Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen."},{"string":"45. Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drave out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of David;"},{"string":"46. Who found favour before God, and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob."},{"string":"47. But Solomon built him an house."},{"string":"48. Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as saith the prophet,"},{"string":"49. Heaven is my throne, and earth is my footstool: what house will ye build me? saith the Lord: or what is the place of my rest?"},{"string":"50. Hath not my hand made all these things?"},{"string":"51. Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do ye."},{"string":"52. Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers:"},{"string":"53. Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it."},{"string":"54. When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth."},{"string":"55. But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,"},{"string":"56. And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God."},{"string":"57. Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord,"},{"string":"58. And cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet, whose name was Saul."},{"string":"59. And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit."},{"string":"60. And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep."}]},{"title":"Acts 8","children":[{"string":"1. And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles."},{"string":"2. And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him."},{"string":"3. As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison."},{"string":"4. Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word."},{"string":"5. Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them."},{"string":"6. And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did."},{"string":"7. For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed."},{"string":"8. And there was great joy in that city."},{"string":"9. But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:"},{"string":"10. To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God."},{"string":"11. And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries."},{"string":"12. But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women."},{"string":"13. Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done."},{"string":"14. Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:"},{"string":"15. Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:"},{"string":"16. (For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)"},{"string":"17. Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost."},{"string":"18. And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,"},{"string":"19. Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost."},{"string":"20. But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money."},{"string":"21. Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God."},{"string":"22. Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee."},{"string":"23. For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity."},{"string":"24. Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the LORD for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me."},{"string":"25. And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans."},{"string":"26.

And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship,"},{"string":"28.

And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?"},{"string":"31. And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him."},{"string":"32. The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:"},{"string":"33.

And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?"},{"string":"35. Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus."},{"string":"36. And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?"},{"string":"37. And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God."},{"string":"38. And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him."},{"string":"39. And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing."},{"string":"40.

And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven:"},{"string":"4. And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?"},{"string":"5. And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks."},{"string":"6. And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do."},{"string":"7.

This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven."},{"string":"17. Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made enquiry for Simon's house, and stood before the gate,"},{"string":"18.

While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee."},{"string":"20. Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them."},{"string":"21. Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the cause wherefore ye are come?"},{"string":"22. And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee."},{"string":"23. Then called he them in, and lodged them. And on the morrow Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him."},{"string":"24.

And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean."},{"string":"29. Therefore came I unto you without gainsaying, as soon as I was sent for: I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me?"},{"string":"30. And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,"},{"string":"31.

Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God."},{"string":"34.

And this was done three times: and all were drawn up again into heaven."},{"string":"11. And, behold, immediately there were three men already come unto the house where I was, sent from Caesarea unto me."},{"string":"12. And the Spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting.

Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost."},{"string":"17. Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; what was I, that I could withstand God?"},{"string":"18. When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life."},{"string":"19.

Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, which gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands."},{"string":"4. But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles."},{"string":"5. And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also of the Jews with their rulers, to use them despitefully, and to stone them,"},{"string":"6. They were ware of it, and fled unto Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and unto the region that lieth round about:"},{"string":"7. And there they preached the gospel."},{"string":"8. And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet, being a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked:"},{"string":"9. The same heard Paul speak: who stedfastly beholding him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed,"},{"string":"10. Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped and walked."},{"string":"11. And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men."},{"string":"12. And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, because he was the chief speaker."},{"string":"13. Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the people."},{"string":"14. Which when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out,"},{"string":"15. And saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein:"},{"string":"16. Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways."},{"string":"17. Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness."},{"string":"18. And with these sayings scarce restrained they the people, that they had not done sacrifice unto them."},{"string":"19. And there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium, who persuaded the people, and having stoned Paul, drew him out of the city, supposing he had been dead."},{"string":"20. Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and came into the city: and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe."},{"string":"21. And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antioch,"},{"string":"22. Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God."},{"string":"23. And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed."},{"string":"24. And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia."},{"string":"25. And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down into Attalia:"},{"string":"26. And thence sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled."},{"string":"27. And when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles."},{"string":"28. And there they abode long time with the disciples."}]},{"title":"Acts 15","children":[{"string":"1. And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brethren, and said, Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved."},{"string":"2. When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question."},{"string":"3. And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren."},{"string":"4. And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them."},{"string":"5. But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses."},{"string":"6. And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter."},{"string":"7. And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe."},{"string":"8. And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as he did unto us;"},{"string":"9. And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith."},{"string":"10. Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?"},{"string":"11. But we believe that through the grace of the LORD Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they."},{"string":"12. Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them."},{"string":"13. And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men and brethren, hearken unto me:"},{"string":"14. Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name."},{"string":"15. And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,"},{"string":"16. After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up:"},{"string":"17. That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these things."},{"string":"18. Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world."},{"string":"19. Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God:"},{"string":"20. But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood."},{"string":"21. For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day."},{"string":"22. Then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas and Silas, chief men among the brethren:"},{"string":"23. And they wrote letters by them after this manner; The apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia."},{"string":"24. Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment:"},{"string":"25. It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,"},{"string":"26. Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ."},{"string":"27. We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell you the same things by mouth."},{"string":"28. For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things;"},{"string":"29. That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well."},{"string":"30. So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle:"},{"string":"31. Which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation."},{"string":"32. And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them."},{"string":"33. And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles."},{"string":"34. Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still."},{"string":"35. Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also."},{"string":"36. And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the LORD, and see how they do."},{"string":"37. And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark."},{"string":"38. But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work."},{"string":"39. And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus;"},{"string":"40. And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of God."},{"string":"41. And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches."}]},{"title":"Acts 16","children":[{"string":"1.

Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters: for they knew all that his father was a Greek."},{"string":"4. And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem."},{"string":"5. And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily."},{"string":"6. Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,"},{"string":"7. After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered them not."},{"string":"8. And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas."},{"string":"9. And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us."},{"string":"10. And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them."},{"string":"11. Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis;"},{"string":"12. And from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony: and we were in that city abiding certain days."},{"string":"13. And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto the women which resorted thither."},{"string":"14. And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul."},{"string":"15. And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide there. And she constrained us."},{"string":"16. And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying:"},{"string":"17. The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation."},{"string":"18. And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour."},{"string":"19. And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers,"},{"string":"20. And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,"},{"string":"21. And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans."},{"string":"22. And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat them."},{"string":"23. And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely:"},{"string":"24. Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks."},{"string":"25. And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them."},{"string":"26. And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one's bands were loosed."},{"string":"27. And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled."},{"string":"28. But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here."},{"string":"29. Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas,"},{"string":"30. And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"},{"string":"31. And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house."},{"string":"32. And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house."},{"string":"33. And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway."},{"string":"34. And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house."},{"string":"35. And when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying, Let those men go."},{"string":"36. And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in peace."},{"string":"37. But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves and fetch us out."},{"string":"38. And the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates: and they feared, when they heard that they were Romans."},{"string":"39. And they came and besought them, and brought them out, and desired them to depart out of the city."},{"string":"40. And they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed."}]},{"title":"Acts 17","children":[{"string":"1. Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:"},{"string":"2. And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures,"},{"string":"3. Opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is Christ."},{"string":"4. And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few."},{"string":"5. But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people."},{"string":"6. And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also;"},{"string":"7. Whom Jason hath received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus."},{"string":"8. And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things."},{"string":"9. And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other, they let them go."},{"string":"10. And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea: who coming thither went into the synagogue of the Jews."},{"string":"11. These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so."},{"string":"12. Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women which were Greeks, and of men, not a few."},{"string":"13. But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and stirred up the people."},{"string":"14. And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus abode there still."},{"string":"15. And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed, they departed."},{"string":"16. Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry."},{"string":"17. Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him."},{"string":"18. Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks, encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection."},{"string":"19. And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is?"},{"string":"20. For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean."},{"string":"21. (For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)"},{"string":"22. Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill, and said, Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious."},{"string":"23. For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you."},{"string":"24. God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;"},{"string":"25. Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;"},{"string":"26.

For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring."},{"string":"29. Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man's device."},{"string":"30. And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent:"},{"string":"31. Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead."},{"string":"32. And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of this matter."},{"string":"33. So Paul departed from among them."},{"string":"34.

And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers."},{"string":"4. And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks."},{"string":"5. And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ."},{"string":"6. And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his raiment, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean; from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles."},{"string":"7. And he departed thence, and entered into a certain man's house, named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue."},{"string":"8. And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized."},{"string":"9. Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace:"},{"string":"10. For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city."},{"string":"11. And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them."},{"string":"12. And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,"},{"string":"13. Saying, This fellow persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law."},{"string":"14. And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:"},{"string":"15. But if it be a question of words and names, and of your law, look ye to it; for I will be no judge of such matters."},{"string":"16. And he drave them from the judgment seat."},{"string":"17. Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things."},{"string":"18. And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow."},{"string":"19.

When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he consented not;"},{"string":"21. But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus."},{"string":"22. And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch."},{"string":"23. And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples."},{"string":"24. And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus."},{"string":"25. This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John."},{"string":"26. And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly."},{"string":"27. And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace:"},{"string":"28.

And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John's baptism."},{"string":"4. Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus."},{"string":"5. When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus."},{"string":"6. And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied."},{"string":"7. And all the men were about twelve."},{"string":"8. And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God."},{"string":"9. But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus."},{"string":"10. And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks."},{"string":"11. And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul:"},{"string":"12. So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them."},{"string":"13. Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the LORD Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth."},{"string":"14. And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the priests, which did so."},{"string":"15. And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye?"},{"string":"16. And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded."},{"string":"17. And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified."},{"string":"18. And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their deeds."},{"string":"19. Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver."},{"string":"20. So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed."},{"string":"21. After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome."},{"string":"22. So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season."},{"string":"23. And the same time there arose no small stir about that way."},{"string":"24. For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen;"},{"string":"25.

Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands:"},{"string":"27. So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth."},{"string":"28. And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians."},{"string":"29. And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre."},{"string":"30. And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not."},{"string":"31. And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent unto him, desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theatre."},{"string":"32. Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused: and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together."},{"string":"33. And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defence unto the people."},{"string":"34. But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians."},{"string":"35. And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?"},{"string":"36. Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly."},{"string":"37. For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess."},{"string":"38. Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them implead one another."},{"string":"39. But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly."},{"string":"40.

And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead."},{"string":"10. And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said, Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him."},{"string":"11. When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed."},{"string":"12. And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted."},{"string":"13. And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot."},{"string":"14. And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene."},{"string":"15. And we sailed thence, and came the next day over against Chios; and the next day we arrived at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium; and the next day we came to Miletus."},{"string":"16. For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost."},{"string":"17. And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church."},{"string":"18. And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons,"},{"string":"19. Serving the LORD with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews:"},{"string":"20. And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have shewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from house to house,"},{"string":"21. Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ."},{"string":"22. And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there:"},{"string":"23. Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me."},{"string":"24. But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God."},{"string":"25. And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more."},{"string":"26. Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men."},{"string":"27. For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God."},{"string":"28. Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood."},{"string":"29. For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock."},{"string":"30. Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them."},{"string":"31. Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears."},{"string":"32. And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified."},{"string":"33. I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel."},{"string":"34. Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me."},{"string":"35. I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive."},{"string":"36. And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all."},{"string":"37. And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him,"},{"string":"38. Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto the ship."}]},{"title":"Acts 21","children":[{"string":"1. And it came to pass, that after we were gotten from them, and had launched, we came with a straight course unto Coos, and the day following unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara:"},{"string":"2. And finding a ship sailing over unto Phenicia, we went aboard, and set forth."},{"string":"3. Now when we had discovered Cyprus, we left it on the left hand, and sailed into Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the ship was to unlade her burden."},{"string":"4. And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem."},{"string":"5. And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went our way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children, till we were out of the city: and we kneeled down on the shore, and prayed."},{"string":"6. And when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship; and they returned home again."},{"string":"7. And when we had finished our course from Tyre, we came to Ptolemais, and saluted the brethren, and abode with them one day."},{"string":"8. And the next day we that were of Paul's company departed, and came unto Caesarea: and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, which was one of the seven; and abode with him."},{"string":"9. And the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did prophesy."},{"string":"10. And as we tarried there many days, there came down from Judaea a certain prophet, named Agabus."},{"string":"11. And when he was come unto us, he took Paul's girdle, and bound his own hands and feet, and said, Thus saith the Holy Ghost, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles."},{"string":"12. And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that place, besought him not to go up to Jerusalem."},{"string":"13. Then Paul answered, What mean ye to weep and to break mine heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus."},{"string":"14. And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done."},{"string":"15. And after those days we took up our carriages, and went up to Jerusalem."},{"string":"16. There went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea, and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge."},{"string":"17. And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly."},{"string":"18. And the day following Paul went in with us unto James; and all the elders were present."},{"string":"19. And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry."},{"string":"20. And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law:"},{"string":"21. And they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs."},{"string":"22. What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together: for they will hear that thou art come."},{"string":"23. Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which have a vow on them;"},{"string":"24. Them take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave their heads: and all may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee, are nothing; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law."},{"string":"25. As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from strangled, and from fornication."},{"string":"26. Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification, until that an offering should be offered for every one of them."},{"string":"27. And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him,"},{"string":"28. Crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that teacheth all men every where against the people, and the law, and this place: and further brought Greeks also into the temple, and hath polluted this holy place."},{"string":"29. (For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)"},{"string":"30. And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and they took Paul, and drew him out of the temple: and forthwith the doors were shut."},{"string":"31. And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar."},{"string":"32. Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto them: and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left beating of Paul."},{"string":"33. Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and what he had done."},{"string":"34. And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude: and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle."},{"string":"35. And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people."},{"string":"36. For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him."},{"string":"37. And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the chief captain, May I speak unto thee? Who said, Canst thou speak Greek?"},{"string":"38. Art not thou that Egyptian, which before these days madest an uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers?"},{"string":"39. But Paul said, I am a man which am a Jew of Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and, I beseech thee, suffer me to speak unto the people."},{"string":"40. And when he had given him licence, Paul stood on the stairs, and beckoned with the hand unto the people.

Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defence which I make now unto you."},{"string":"2.

I am verily a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day."},{"string":"4. And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women."},{"string":"5. As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring them which were there bound unto Jerusalem, for to be punished."},{"string":"6. And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come nigh unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me."},{"string":"7. And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?"},{"string":"8. And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest."},{"string":"9. And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me."},{"string":"10. And I said, What shall I do, LORD? And the Lord said unto me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do."},{"string":"11. And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus."},{"string":"12. And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt there,"},{"string":"13. Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him."},{"string":"14. And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth."},{"string":"15. For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard."},{"string":"16. And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord."},{"string":"17. And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;"},{"string":"18. And saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me."},{"string":"19. And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee:"},{"string":"20. And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him."},{"string":"21. And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles."},{"string":"22. And they gave him audience unto this word, and then lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live."},{"string":"23. And as they cried out, and cast off their clothes, and threw dust into the air,"},{"string":"24. The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him."},{"string":"25. And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?"},{"string":"26. When the centurion heard that, he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a Roman."},{"string":"27. Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yea."},{"string":"28. And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was free born."},{"string":"29. Then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him."},{"string":"30. On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from his bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them."}]},{"title":"Acts 23","children":[{"string":"1. And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day."},{"string":"2. And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth."},{"string":"3. Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall: for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?"},{"string":"4. And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God's high priest?"},{"string":"5. Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people."},{"string":"6. But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question."},{"string":"7. And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided."},{"string":"8. For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both."},{"string":"9. And there arose a great cry: and the scribes that were of the Pharisees' part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight against God."},{"string":"10. And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring him into the castle."},{"string":"11. And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, Paul: for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome."},{"string":"12. And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul."},{"string":"13. And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy."},{"string":"14. And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul."},{"string":"15. Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would enquire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him."},{"string":"16. And when Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the castle, and told Paul."},{"string":"17. Then Paul called one of the centurions unto him, and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a certain thing to tell him."},{"string":"18. So he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and said, Paul the prisoner called me unto him, and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto thee."},{"string":"19. Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went with him aside privately, and asked him, What is that thou hast to tell me?"},{"string":"20. And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though they would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly."},{"string":"21. But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee."},{"string":"22. So the chief captain then let the young man depart, and charged him, See thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me."},{"string":"23. And he called unto him two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night;"},{"string":"24.

Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix sendeth greeting."},{"string":"27. This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman."},{"string":"28. And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their council:"},{"string":"29. Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds."},{"string":"30. And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man, I sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what they had against him. Farewell."},{"string":"31. Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought him by night to Antipatris."},{"string":"32. On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle:"},{"string":"33. Who, when they came to Caesarea and delivered the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him."},{"string":"34. And when the governor had read the letter, he asked of what province he was. And when he understood that he was of Cilicia;"},{"string":"35. I will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's judgment hall."}]},{"title":"Acts 24","children":[{"string":"1. And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders, and with a certain orator named Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul."},{"string":"2.

We accept it always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness."},{"string":"4. Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words."},{"string":"5. For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:"},{"string":"6. Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law."},{"string":"7. But the chief captain Lysias came upon us, and with great violence took him away out of our hands,"},{"string":"8. Commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him."},{"string":"9. And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so."},{"string":"10. Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself:"},{"string":"11. Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship."},{"string":"12. And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:"},{"string":"13. Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me."},{"string":"14. But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:"},{"string":"15. And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust."},{"string":"16. And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void to offence toward God, and toward men."},{"string":"17. Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings."},{"string":"18. Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult."},{"string":"19. Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had ought against me."},{"string":"20. Or else let these same here say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council,"},{"string":"21. Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day."},{"string":"22. And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of that way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter."},{"string":"23. And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let him have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him."},{"string":"24. And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ."},{"string":"25. And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee."},{"string":"26. He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him."},{"string":"27. But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' room: and Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound."}]},{"title":"Acts 25","children":[{"string":"1. Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem."},{"string":"2. Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul, and besought him,"},{"string":"3.

But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would depart shortly thither."},{"string":"5. Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down with me, and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him."},{"string":"6. And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down unto Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded Paul to be brought."},{"string":"7. And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove."},{"string":"8. While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have I offended any thing at all."},{"string":"9. But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?"},{"string":"10. Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou very well knowest."},{"string":"11. For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal unto Caesar."},{"string":"12. Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Hast thou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou go."},{"string":"13. And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto Caesarea to salute Festus."},{"string":"14. And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul's cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix:"},{"string":"15. About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, desiring to have judgment against him."},{"string":"16. To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face, and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him."},{"string":"17. Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth."},{"string":"18. Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed:"},{"string":"19. But had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive."},{"string":"20. And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these matters."},{"string":"21. But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar."},{"string":"22. Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself. To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him."},{"string":"23. And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus' commandment Paul was brought forth."},{"string":"24. And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and also here, crying that he ought not to live any longer."},{"string":"25. But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him."},{"string":"26. Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write."},{"string":"27.

Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision:"},{"string":"20. But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance."},{"string":"21. For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill me."},{"string":"22. Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come:"},{"string":"23. That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles."},{"string":"24. And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad."},{"string":"25. But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness."},{"string":"26. For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner."},{"string":"27. King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest."},{"string":"28. Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian."},{"string":"29. And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds."},{"string":"30. And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them:"},{"string":"31. And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds."},{"string":"32.

And the next day we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously entreated Paul, and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself."},{"string":"4. And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary."},{"string":"5. And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia."},{"string":"6. And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and he put us therein."},{"string":"7. And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone;"},{"string":"8. And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea."},{"string":"9. Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them,"},{"string":"10.

Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul."},{"string":"12. And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, and there to winter; which is an haven of Crete, and lieth toward the south west and north west."},{"string":"13. And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, loosing thence, they sailed close by Crete."},{"string":"14. But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon."},{"string":"15. And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let her drive."},{"string":"16. And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat:"},{"string":"17. Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, strake sail, and so were driven."},{"string":"18. And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day they lightened the ship;"},{"string":"19. And the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship."},{"string":"20.

And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you, but of the ship."},{"string":"23. For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,"},{"string":"24. Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee."},{"string":"25.

And sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it fifteen fathoms."},{"string":"29. Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day."},{"string":"30. And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,"},{"string":"31. Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved."},{"string":"32. Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off."},{"string":"33. And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing."},{"string":"34. Wherefore I pray you to take some meat: for this is for your health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you."},{"string":"35. And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat."},{"string":"36. Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some meat."},{"string":"37. And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls."},{"string":"38. And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea."},{"string":"39. And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship."},{"string":"40. And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore."},{"string":"41. And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves."},{"string":"42. And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape."},{"string":"43. But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea, and get to land:"},{"string":"44.

And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand."},{"string":"4. And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live."},{"string":"5. And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm."},{"string":"6. Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god."},{"string":"7. In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously."},{"string":"8. And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him."},{"string":"9.

For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain."},{"string":"21.

If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die."},{"string":"33. Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners."},{"string":"34. Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame."},{"string":"35. But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?"},{"string":"36. Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die:"},{"string":"37. And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain:"},{"string":"38. But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body."},{"string":"39. All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds."},{"string":"40. There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another."},{"string":"41. There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory."},{"string":"42. So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:"},{"string":"43. It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:"},{"string":"44. It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body."},{"string":"45. And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit."},{"string":"46. Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual."},{"string":"47. The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven."},{"string":"48. As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly."},{"string":"49. And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly."},{"string":"50. Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption."},{"string":"51. Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,"},{"string":"52. In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed."},{"string":"53. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality."},{"string":"54. So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory."},{"string":"55. O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?"},{"string":"56. The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law."},{"string":"57. But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ."},{"string":"58.

How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?"},{"string":"15. And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance."},{"string":"16. For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator."},{"string":"17. For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth."},{"string":"18. Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood."},{"string":"19.

Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry."},{"string":"22. And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission."},{"string":"23. It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these."},{"string":"24. For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:"},{"string":"25. Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;"},{"string":"26.
