2 Chronicles 3,"3. Now these are the things wherein Solomon was instructed for the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first measure was threescore cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits."
2 Chronicles 3,"4. And the porch that was in the front of the house, the length of it was according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the height was an hundred and twenty: and he overlaid it within with pure gold."
2 Chronicles 3,"5. And the greater house he cieled with fir tree, which he overlaid with fine gold, and set thereon palm trees and chains."
2 Chronicles 3,6. And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and the gold was gold of Parvaim.
2 Chronicles 3,"7. He overlaid also the house, the beams, the posts, and the walls thereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and graved cherubim on the walls."

2 Chronicles 3,"12. And one wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing was five cubits also, joining to the wing of the other cherub."
2 Chronicles 3,"13. The wings of these cherubim spread themselves forth twenty cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces were inward."
2 Chronicles 3,"14. And he made the vail of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and wrought cherubim thereon."
2 Chronicles 3,"15. Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high, and the chapiter that was on the top of each of them was five cubits."
2 Chronicles 3,"16. And he made chains, as in the oracle, and put them on the heads of the pillars; and made an hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains."
2 Chronicles 3,"17. And he reared up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz."
2 Chronicles 4,"1. Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length thereof, and twenty cubits the breadth thereof, and ten cubits the height thereof."
2 Chronicles 4,"2. Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and five cubits the height thereof; and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about."

2 Chronicles 4,"6. He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them: such things as they offered for the burnt offering they washed in them; but the sea was for the priests to wash in."
2 Chronicles 4,"7. And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form, and set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left."

2 Chronicles 4,"11. And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basins. And Huram finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon for the house of God;"
2 Chronicles 4,"12. To wit, the two pillars, and the pommels, and the chapiters which were on the top of the two pillars, and the two wreaths to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which were on the top of the pillars;"
2 Chronicles 4,"13. And four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths; two rows of pomegranates on each wreath, to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which were upon the pillars."
2 Chronicles 4,"14. He made also bases, and lavers made he upon the bases;"
2 Chronicles 4,"15. One sea, and twelve oxen under it."
2 Chronicles 4,"16. The pots also, and the shovels, and the fleshhooks, and all their instruments, did Huram his father make to king Solomon for the house of the LORD of bright brass."
2 Chronicles 4,"17. In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredathah."

2 Chronicles 4,"19. And Solomon made all the vessels that were for the house of God, the golden altar also, and the tables whereon the shewbread was set;"

2 Chronicles 5,"1. Thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the LORD was finished: and Solomon brought in all the things that David his father had dedicated; and the silver, and the gold, and all the instruments, put he among the treasures of the house of God."
2 Chronicles 5,"2. Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion."
2 Chronicles 5,3. Wherefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king in the feast which was in the seventh month.
2 Chronicles 5,4. And all the elders of Israel came; and the Levites took up the ark.
2 Chronicles 5,"5. And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle, these did the priests and the Levites bring up."
2 Chronicles 5,"6. Also king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that were assembled unto him before the ark, sacrificed sheep and oxen, which could not be told nor numbered for multitude."
2 Chronicles 5,"7. And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his place, to the oracle of the house, into the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim:"
2 Chronicles 5,"8. For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the staves thereof above."
2 Chronicles 5,"9. And they drew out the staves of the ark, that the ends of the staves were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were not seen without. And there it is unto this day."
2 Chronicles 5,"10. There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put therein at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt."
2 Chronicles 5,"11. And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place: (for all the priests that were present were sanctified, and did not then wait by course:"
2 Chronicles 5,"12. Also the Levites which were the singers, all of them of Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren, being arrayed in white linen, having cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them an hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets:)"
2 Chronicles 5,"13. It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the LORD; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, and praised the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever: that then the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of the LORD;"
2 Chronicles 5,14. So that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of God.
2 Chronicles 6,"1. Then said Solomon, The LORD hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness."
2 Chronicles 6,"2. But I have built an house of habitation for thee, and a place for thy dwelling for ever."

2 Chronicles 6,"4. And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who hath with his hands fulfilled that which he spake with his mouth to my father David, saying,"
2 Chronicles 6,"5. Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt I chose no city among all the tribes of Israel to build an house in, that my name might be there; neither chose I any man to be a ruler over my people Israel:"
2 Chronicles 6,"6. But I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and have chosen David to be over my people Israel."
2 Chronicles 6,7. Now it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.
2 Chronicles 6,"8. But the LORD said to David my father, Forasmuch as it was in thine heart to build an house for my name, thou didst well in that it was in thine heart:"
2 Chronicles 6,"9. Notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house; but thy son which shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for my name."
2 Chronicles 6,"10. The LORD therefore hath performed his word that he hath spoken: for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and am set on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built the house for the name of the LORD God of Israel."
2 Chronicles 6,"11. And in it have I put the ark, wherein is the covenant of the LORD, that he made with the children of Israel."
2 Chronicles 6,"12. And he stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands:"
2 Chronicles 6,"13. For Solomon had made a brazen scaffold of five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court: and upon it he stood, and kneeled down upon his knees before all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven."
2 Chronicles 6,"14. And said, O LORD God of Israel, there is no God like thee in the heaven, nor in the earth; which keepest covenant, and showest mercy unto thy servants, that walk before thee with all their hearts:"
2 Chronicles 6,"15. Thou which hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him; and spakest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thine hand, as it is this day."
2 Chronicles 6,"16. Now therefore, O LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit upon the throne of Israel; yet so that thy children take heed to their way to walk in my law, as thou hast walked before me."
2 Chronicles 6,"17. Now then, O LORD God of Israel, let thy word be verified, which thou hast spoken unto thy servant David."
2 Chronicles 6,"18. But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house which I have built!"
2 Chronicles 6,"19. Have respect therefore to the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee:"
2 Chronicles 6,"20. That thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night, upon the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put thy name there; to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant prayeth toward this place."
2 Chronicles 6,"21. Hearken therefore unto the supplications of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, which they shall make toward this place: hear thou from thy dwelling place, even from heaven; and when thou hearest, forgive."
2 Chronicles 6,"22. If a man sin against his neighbor, and an oath be laid upon him to make him swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house;"
2 Chronicles 6,"23. Then hear thou from heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, by requiting the wicked, by recompensing his way upon his own head; and by justifying the righteous, by giving him according to his righteousness."
2 Chronicles 6,"24. And if thy people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee; and shall return and confess thy name, and pray and make supplication before thee in this house;"
2 Chronicles 6,"25. Then hear thou from the heavens, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest to them and to their fathers."
2 Chronicles 6,"26. When the heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; yet if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou dost afflict them;"
2 Chronicles 6,"27. Then hear thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, when thou hast taught them the good way, wherein they should walk; and send rain upon thy land, which thou hast given unto thy people for an inheritance."
2 Chronicles 6,"28. If there be dearth in the land, if there be pestilence, if there be blasting, or mildew, locusts, or caterpillars; if their enemies besiege them in the cities of their land; whatsoever sore or whatsoever sickness there be:"
2 Chronicles 6,"29. Then what prayer or what supplication soever shall be made of any man, or of all thy people Israel, when every one shall know his own sore and his own grief, and shall spread forth his hands in this house:"
2 Chronicles 6,"30. Then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and render unto every man according unto all his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou only knowest the hearts of the children of men:)"
2 Chronicles 6,"31. That they may fear thee, to walk in thy ways, so long as they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers."
2 Chronicles 6,"32. Moreover concerning the stranger, which is not of thy people Israel, but is come from a far country for thy great name's sake, and thy mighty hand, and thy stretched out arm; if they come and pray in this house;"
2 Chronicles 6,"33. Then hear thou from the heavens, even from thy dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for; that all people of the earth may know thy name, and fear thee, as doth thy people Israel, and may know that this house which I have built is called by thy name."
2 Chronicles 6,"34. If thy people go out to war against their enemies by the way that thou shalt send them, and they pray unto thee toward this city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name;"
2 Chronicles 6,"35. Then hear thou from the heavens their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause."
2 Chronicles 6,"36. If they sin against thee, (for there is no man which sinneth not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them over before their enemies, and they carry them away captives unto a land far off or near;"
2 Chronicles 6,"37. Yet if they bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive, and turn and pray unto thee in the land of their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done amiss, and have dealt wickedly;"
2 Chronicles 6,"38. If they return to thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, whither they have carried them captives, and pray toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, and toward the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the house which I have built for thy name:"
2 Chronicles 6,"39. Then hear thou from the heavens, even from thy dwelling place, their prayer and their supplications, and maintain their cause, and forgive thy people which have sinned against thee."
2 Chronicles 6,"40. Now, my God, let, I beseech thee, thine eyes be open, and let thine ears be attent unto the prayer that is made in this place."
2 Chronicles 6,"41. Now therefore arise, O LORD God, into thy resting place, thou, and the ark of thy strength: let thy priests, O LORD God, be clothed with salvation, and let thy saints rejoice in goodness."
2 Chronicles 6,"42. O LORD God, turn not away the face of thine anointed: remember the mercies of David thy servant."
2 Chronicles 7,"1. Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of the LORD filled the house."
2 Chronicles 7,"2. And the priests could not enter into the house of the LORD, because the glory of the LORD had filled the LORD's house."
2 Chronicles 7,"3. And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down, and the glory of the LORD upon the house, they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement, and worshipped, and praised the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever."
2 Chronicles 7,4. Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the LORD.
2 Chronicles 7,"5. And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep: so the king and all the people dedicated the house of God."
2 Chronicles 7,"6. And the priests waited on their offices: the Levites also with instruments of music of the LORD, which David the king had made to praise the LORD, because his mercy endureth for ever, when David praised by their ministry; and the priests sounded trumpets before them, and all Israel stood."
2 Chronicles 7,"7. Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the brazen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offerings, and the meat offerings, and the fat."
2 Chronicles 7,"8. Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt."
2 Chronicles 7,"9. And in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly: for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days."
2 Chronicles 7,"10. And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away into their tents, glad and merry in heart for the goodness that the LORD had showed unto David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his people."
2 Chronicles 7,"11. Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD, and the king's house: and all that came into Solomon's heart to make in the house of the LORD, and in his own house, he prosperously effected."
2 Chronicles 7,"12. And the LORD appeared to Solomon by night, and said unto him, I have heard thy prayer, and have chosen this place to myself for an house of sacrifice."
2 Chronicles 7,"13. If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people;"
2 Chronicles 7,"14. If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land."
2 Chronicles 7,"15. Now mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears attent unto the prayer that is made in this place."
2 Chronicles 7,"16. For now have I chosen and sanctified this house, that my name may be there for ever: and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually."
2 Chronicles 7,"17. And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded thee, and shalt observe my statutes and my judgments;"
2 Chronicles 7,"18. Then will I stablish the throne of thy kingdom, according as I have covenanted with David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man to be ruler in Israel."
2 Chronicles 7,"19. But if ye turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments, which I have set before you, and shall go and serve other gods, and worship them;"
2 Chronicles 7,"20. Then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have sanctified for my name, will I cast out of my sight, and will make it to be a proverb and a byword among all nations."
2 Chronicles 7,"21. And this house, which is high, shall be an astonishment to every one that passeth by it; so that he shall say, Why hath the LORD done thus unto this land, and unto this house?"
2 Chronicles 7,"22. And it shall be answered, Because they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, which brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath he brought all this evil upon them."
2 Chronicles 8,"1. And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon had built the house of the LORD, and his own house,"
2 Chronicles 8,"2. That the cities which Huram had restored to Solomon, Solomon built them, and caused the children of Israel to dwell there."
2 Chronicles 8,"3. And Solomon went to Hamathzobah, and prevailed against it."
2 Chronicles 8,"4. And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store cities, which he built in Hamath."
2 Chronicles 8,"5. Also he built Bethhoron the upper, and Bethhoron the nether, fenced cities, with walls, gates, and bars;"
2 Chronicles 8,"6. And Baalath, and all the store cities that Solomon had, and all the chariot cities, and the cities of the horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and throughout all the land of his dominion."
2 Chronicles 8,"7. As for all the people that were left of the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which were not of Israel,"
2 Chronicles 8,"8. But of their children, who were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel consumed not, them did Solomon make to pay tribute until this day."
2 Chronicles 8,"9. But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for his work; but they were men of war, and chief of his captains, and captains of his chariots and horsemen."
2 Chronicles 8,"10. And these were the chief of king Solomon's officers, even two hundred and fifty, that bare rule over the people."
2 Chronicles 8,"11. And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of David unto the house that he had built for her: for he said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the places are holy, whereunto the ark of the LORD hath come."
2 Chronicles 8,"12. Then Solomon offered burnt offerings unto the LORD on the altar of the LORD, which he had built before the porch,"
2 Chronicles 8,"13. Even after a certain rate every day, offering according to the commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts, three times in the year, even in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles."
2 Chronicles 8,"14. And he appointed, according to the order of David his father, the courses of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their charges, to praise and minister before the priests, as the duty of every day required: the porters also by their courses at every gate: for so had David the man of God commanded."
2 Chronicles 8,"15. And they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the treasures."
2 Chronicles 8,"16. Now all the work of Solomon was prepared unto the day of the foundation of the house of the LORD, and until it was finished. So the house of the LORD was perfected."
2 Chronicles 8,"17. Then went Solomon to Eziongeber, and to Eloth, at the sea side in the land of Edom."
2 Chronicles 8,"18. And Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships, and servants that had knowledge of the sea; and they went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and took thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon."
2 Chronicles 9,"1. And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great company, and camels that bare spices, and gold in abundance, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart."
2 Chronicles 9,2. And Solomon told her all her questions: and there was nothing hid from Solomon which he told her not.
2 Chronicles 9,"3. And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,"
2 Chronicles 9,"4. And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel; his cupbearers also, and their apparel; and his ascent by which he went up into the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her."
2 Chronicles 9,"5. And she said to the king, It was a true report which I heard in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom:"
2 Chronicles 9,"6. Howbeit I believed not their words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold, the one half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me: for thou exceedest the fame that I heard."
2 Chronicles 9,"7. Happy are thy men, and happy are these thy servants, which stand continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom."
2 Chronicles 9,"8. Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee to set thee on his throne, to be king for the LORD thy God: because thy God loved Israel, to establish them for ever, therefore made he thee king over them, to do judgment and justice."
2 Chronicles 9,"9. And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices great abundance, and precious stones: neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave king Solomon."
2 Chronicles 9,"10. And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, which brought gold from Ophir, brought algum trees and precious stones."
2 Chronicles 9,"11. And the king made of the algum trees terraces to the house of the LORD, and to the king's palace, and harps and psalteries for singers: and there were none such seen before in the land of Judah."
2 Chronicles 9,"12. And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside that which she had brought unto the king. So she turned, and went away to her own land, she and her servants."
2 Chronicles 9,13. Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold;
2 Chronicles 9,14. Beside that which chapmen and merchants brought. And all the kings of Arabia and governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon.
2 Chronicles 9,15. And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one target.

2 Chronicles 13,"10. But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken him; and the priests, which minister unto the LORD, are the sons of Aaron, and the Levites wait upon their business:"
2 Chronicles 13,"11. And they burn unto the LORD every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense: the shewbread also set they in order upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of the LORD our God; but ye have forsaken him."

Ezra 2,"60. The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred fifty and two."

Ezra 2,"62. These sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy, but they were not found: therefore were they, as polluted, put from the priesthood."
Ezra 2,"63. And the Tirshatha said unto them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim and with Thummim."
Ezra 2,"64. The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore,"
Ezra 2,"65. Beside their servants and their maids, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and there were among them two hundred singing men and singing women."

Ezra 2,"68. And some of the chief of the fathers, when they came to the house of the LORD which is at Jerusalem, offered freely for the house of God to set it up in his place:"
Ezra 2,"69. They gave after their ability unto the treasure of the work threescore and one thousand drams of gold, and five thousand pound of silver, and one hundred priests' garments."
Ezra 2,"70. So the priests, and the Levites, and some of the people, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, dwelt in their cities, and all Israel in their cities."
Ezra 3,"1. And when the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem."
Ezra 3,"2. Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and builded the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God."
Ezra 3,"3. And they set the altar upon his bases; for fear was upon them because of the people of those countries: and they offered burnt offerings thereon unto the LORD, even burnt offerings morning and evening."
Ezra 3,"4. They kept also the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and offered the daily burnt offerings by number, according to the custom, as the duty of every day required;"
Ezra 3,"5. And afterward offered the continual burnt offering, both of the new moons, and of all the set feasts of the LORD that were consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a freewill offering unto the LORD."
Ezra 3,6. From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt offerings unto the LORD. But the foundation of the temple of the LORD was not yet laid.
Ezra 3,"7. They gave money also unto the masons, and to the carpenters; and meat, and drink, and oil, unto them of Zidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia."
Ezra 3,"8. Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem; and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to set forward the work of the house of the LORD."
Ezra 3,"9. Then stood Jeshua with his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to set forward the workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad, with their sons and their brethren the Levites."
Ezra 3,"10. And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the LORD, after the ordinance of David king of Israel."
Ezra 3,"11. And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks unto the LORD; because he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid."
Ezra 3,"12. But many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers, who were ancient men, that had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy:"
Ezra 3,"13. So that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people: for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off."
Ezra 4,1. Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity builded the temple unto the LORD God of Israel;
Ezra 4,"2. Then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the fathers, and said unto them, Let us build with you: for we seek your God, as ye do; and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assur, which brought us up hither."
Ezra 4,"3. But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with us to build an house unto our God; but we ourselves together will build unto the LORD God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us."
Ezra 4,"4. Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building,"
Ezra 4,"5. And hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia."
Ezra 4,"6. And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they unto him an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem."
Ezra 4,"7. And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of their companions, unto Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the writing of the letter was written in the Syrian tongue, and interpreted in the Syrian tongue."
Ezra 4,8. Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort:
Ezra 4,"9. Then wrote Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions; the Dinaites, the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Susanchites, the Dehavites, and the Elamites,"
Ezra 4,"10. And the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asnapper brought over, and set in the cities of Samaria, and the rest that are on this side the river, and at such a time."
Ezra 4,"11. This is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him, even unto Artaxerxes the king; Thy servants the men on this side the river, and at such a time."
Ezra 4,"12. Be it known unto the king, that the Jews which came up from thee to us are come unto Jerusalem, building the rebellious and the bad city, and have set up the walls thereof, and joined the foundations."
Ezra 4,"13. Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded, and the walls set up again, then will they not pay toll, tribute, and custom, and so thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings."
Ezra 4,"14. Now because we have maintenance from the king's palace, and it was not meet for us to see the king's dishonour, therefore have we sent and certified the king;"
Ezra 4,"15. That search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful unto kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time: for which cause was this city destroyed."
Ezra 4,"16. We certify the king that, if this city be builded again, and the walls thereof set up, by this means thou shalt have no portion on this side the river."
Ezra 4,"17. Then sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria, and unto the rest beyond the river, Peace, and at such a time."
Ezra 4,18. The letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me.
Ezra 4,"19. And I commanded, and search hath been made, and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein."
Ezra 4,"20. There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, which have ruled over all countries beyond the river; and toll, tribute, and custom, was paid unto them."
Ezra 4,"21. Give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not builded, until another commandment shall be given from me."
Ezra 4,22. Take heed now that ye fail not to do this: why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings?
Ezra 4,"23. Now when the copy of king Artaxerxes' letter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power."
Ezra 4,24. Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem. So it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.
Ezra 5,"1. Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, even unto them."
Ezra 5,"2. Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem: and with them were the prophets of God helping them."
Ezra 5,"3. At the same time came to them Tatnai, governor on this side the river, and Shetharboznai and their companions, and said thus unto them, Who hath commanded you to build this house, and to make up this wall?"
Ezra 5,"4. Then said we unto them after this manner, What are the names of the men that make this building?"
Ezra 5,"5. But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, that they could not cause them to cease, till the matter came to Darius: and then they returned answer by letter concerning this matter."
Ezra 5,"6. The copy of the letter that Tatnai, governor on this side the river, and Shetharboznai and his companions the Apharsachites, which were on this side the river, sent unto Darius the king:"
Ezra 5,"7. They sent a letter unto him, wherein was written thus; Unto Darius the king, all peace."
Ezra 5,"8. Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of Judea, to the house of the great God, which is builded with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work goeth fast on, and prospereth in their hands."
Ezra 5,"9. Then asked we those elders, and said unto them thus, Who commanded you to build this house, and to make up these walls?"
Ezra 5,"10. We asked their names also, to certify thee, that we might write the names of the men that were the chief of them."
Ezra 5,"11. And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and build the house that was builded these many years ago, which a great king of Israel builded and set up."
Ezra 5,"12. But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon."
Ezra 5,13. But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon the same king Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God.
Ezra 5,"14. And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem, and brought them into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered unto one, whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor;"
Ezra 5,"15. And said unto him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be builded in his place."
Ezra 5,"16. Then came the same Sheshbazzar, and laid the foundation of the house of God which is in Jerusalem: and since that time even until now hath it been in building, and yet it is not finished."
Ezra 5,"17. Now therefore, if it seem good to the king, let there be search made in the king's treasure house, which is there at Babylon, whether it be so, that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter."
Ezra 6,"1. Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the house of the rolls, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon."
Ezra 6,"2. And there was found at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the province of the Medes, a roll, and therein was a record thus written:"
Ezra 6,"3. In the first year of Cyrus the king the same Cyrus the king made a decree concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, Let the house be builded, the place where they offered sacrifices, and let the foundations thereof be strongly laid; the height thereof threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof threescore cubits;"
Ezra 6,"4. With three rows of great stones, and a row of new timber: and let the expenses be given out of the king's house:"
Ezra 6,"5. And also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which is at Jerusalem, and brought unto Babylon, be restored, and brought again unto the temple which is at Jerusalem, every one to his place, and place them in the house of God."
Ezra 6,"6. Now therefore, Tatnai, governor beyond the river, Shetharboznai, and your companions the Apharsachites, which are beyond the river, be ye far from thence:"
Ezra 6,7. Let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in his place.
Ezra 6,"8. Moreover I make a decree what ye shall do to the elders of these Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the king's goods, even of the tribute beyond the river, forthwith expenses be given unto these men, that they be not hindered."
Ezra 6,"9. And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the appointment of the priests which are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail:"
Ezra 6,"10. That they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons."
Ezra 6,"11. Also I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this word, let timber be pulled down from his house, and being set up, let him be hanged thereon; and let his house be made a dunghill for this."
Ezra 6,"12. And the God that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy all kings and people, that shall put to their hand to alter and to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem. I Darius have made a decree; let it be done with speed."
Ezra 6,"13. Then Tatnai, governor on this side the river, Shetharboznai, and their companions, according to that which Darius the king had sent, so they did speedily."
Ezra 6,"14. And the elders of the Jews builded, and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they builded, and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia."
Ezra 6,"15. And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king."
Ezra 6,"16. And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with joy."
Ezra 6,"17. And offered at the dedication of this house of God an hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin offering for all Israel, twelve he goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel."
Ezra 6,"18. And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses, for the service of God, which is at Jerusalem; as it is written in the book of Moses."
Ezra 6,19. And the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the fourteenth day of the first month.
Ezra 6,"20. For the priests and the Levites were purified together, all of them were pure, and killed the passover for all the children of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves."
Ezra 6,"21. And the children of Israel, which were come again out of captivity, and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land, to seek the LORD God of Israel, did eat,"
Ezra 6,"22. And kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy: for the LORD had made them joyful, and turned the heart of the king of Assyria unto them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel."
Ezra 7,"1. Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah,"
Ezra 7,"2. The son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub,"
Ezra 7,"3. The son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth,"
Ezra 7,"4. The son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki,"
Ezra 7,"5. The son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest:"
Ezra 7,"6. This Ezra went up from Babylon; and he was a ready scribe in the law of Moses, which the LORD God of Israel had given: and the king granted him all his request, according to the hand of the LORD his God upon him."
Ezra 7,"7. And there went up some of the children of Israel, and of the priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, unto Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king."
Ezra 7,"8. And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king."
Ezra 7,"9. For upon the first day of the first month began he to go up from Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him."
Ezra 7,"10. For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the LORD, and to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments."
Ezra 7,"11. Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave unto Ezra the priest, the scribe, even a scribe of the words of the commandments of the LORD, and of his statutes to Israel."
Ezra 7,"12. Artaxerxes, king of kings, unto Ezra the priest, a scribe of the law of the God of heaven, perfect peace, and at such a time."
Ezra 7,"13. I make a decree, that all they of the people of Israel, and of his priests and Levites, in my realm, which are minded of their own freewill to go up to Jerusalem, go with thee."
Ezra 7,"14. Forasmuch as thou art sent of the king, and of his seven counsellors, to enquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according to the law of thy God which is in thine hand;"
Ezra 7,"15. And to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his counsellors have freely offered unto the God of Israel, whose habitation is in Jerusalem,"
Ezra 7,"16. And all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the province of Babylon, with the freewill offering of the people, and of the priests, offering willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem:"
Ezra 7,"17. That thou mayest buy speedily with this money bullocks, rams, lambs, with their meat offerings and their drink offerings, and offer them upon the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem."
Ezra 7,"18. And whatsoever shall seem good to thee, and to thy brethren, to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, that do after the will of your God."
Ezra 7,"19. The vessels also that are given thee for the service of the house of thy God, those deliver thou before the God of Jerusalem."
Ezra 7,"20. And whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy God, which thou shalt have occasion to bestow, bestow it out of the king's treasure house."
Ezra 7,"21. And I, even I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all the treasurers which are beyond the river, that whatsoever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, shall require of you, it be done speedily,"
Ezra 7,"22. Unto an hundred talents of silver, and to an hundred measures of wheat, and to an hundred baths of wine, and to an hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribing how much."
Ezra 7,"23. Whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be diligently done for the house of the God of heaven: for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons?"
Ezra 7,"24. Also we certify you, that touching any of the priests and Levites, singers, porters, Nethinims, or ministers of this house of God, it shall not be lawful to impose toll, tribute, or custom, upon them."
Ezra 7,"25. And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God, that is in thine hand, set magistrates and judges, which may judge all the people that are beyond the river, all such as know the laws of thy God; and teach ye them that know them not."
Ezra 7,"26. And whosoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law of the king, let judgment be executed speedily upon him, whether it be unto death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment."
Ezra 7,"27. Blessed be the LORD God of our fathers, which hath put such a thing as this in the king's heart, to beautify the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem:"
Ezra 7,"28. And hath extended mercy unto me before the king, and his counsellors, and before all the king's mighty princes. And I was strengthened as the hand of the LORD my God was upon me, and I gathered together out of Israel chief men to go up with me."
Ezra 8,"1. These are now the chief of their fathers, and this is the genealogy of them that went up with me from Babylon, in the reign of Artaxerxes the king."
Ezra 8,2. Of the sons of Phinehas; Gershom: of the sons of Ithamar; Daniel: of the sons of David; Hattush.
Ezra 8,"3. Of the sons of Shechaniah, of the sons of Pharosh; Zechariah: and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males an hundred and fifty."
Ezra 8,"4. Of the sons of Pahathmoab; Elihoenai the son of Zerahiah, and with him two hundred males."
Ezra 8,"5. Of the sons of Shechaniah; the son of Jahaziel, and with him three hundred males."
Ezra 8,"6. Of the sons also of Adin; Ebed the son of Jonathan, and with him fifty males."
Ezra 8,"7. And of the sons of Elam; Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah, and with him seventy males."
Ezra 8,"8. And of the sons of Shephatiah; Zebadiah the son of Michael, and with him fourscore males."
Ezra 8,"9. Of the sons of Joab; Obadiah the son of Jehiel, and with him two hundred and eighteen males."
Ezra 8,"10. And of the sons of Shelomith; the son of Josiphiah, and with him an hundred and threescore males."
Ezra 8,"11. And of the sons of Bebai; Zechariah the son of Bebai, and with him twenty and eight males."
Ezra 8,"12. And of the sons of Azgad; Johanan the son of Hakkatan, and with him an hundred and ten males."
Ezra 8,"13. And of the last sons of Adonikam, whose names are these, Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah, and with them threescore males."
Ezra 8,"14. Of the sons also of Bigvai; Uthai, and Zabbud, and with them seventy males."
Ezra 8,"15. And I gathered them together to the river that runneth to Ahava; and there abode we in tents three days: and I viewed the people, and the priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi."
Ezra 8,"16. Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, men of understanding."
Ezra 8,"17. And I sent them with commandment unto Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia, and I told them what they should say unto Iddo, and to his brethren the Nethinims, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring unto us ministers for the house of our God."
Ezra 8,"18. And by the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of understanding, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren, eighteen;"
Ezra 8,"19. And Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brethren and their sons, twenty;"
Ezra 8,"20. Also of the Nethinims, whom David and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinims: all of them were expressed by name."
Ezra 8,"21. Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava, that we might afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance."
Ezra 8,"22. For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all them for good that seek him; but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him."
Ezra 8,23. So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was intreated of us.
Ezra 8,"24. Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them,"
Ezra 8,"25. And weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, even the offering of the house of our God, which the king, and his counsellors, and his lords, and all Israel there present, had offered:"
Ezra 8,"26. I even weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels an hundred talents, and of gold an hundred talents;"
Ezra 8,"27. Also twenty basons of gold, of a thousand drams; and two vessels of fine copper, precious as gold."
Ezra 8,"28. And I said unto them, Ye are holy unto the LORD; the vessels are holy also; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering unto the LORD God of your fathers."
Ezra 8,"29. Watch ye, and keep them, until ye weigh them before the chief of the priests and the Levites, and chief of the fathers of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the LORD."
Ezra 8,"30. So took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house of our God."
Ezra 8,"31. Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, to go unto Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in wait by the way."
Ezra 8,"32. And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days."
Ezra 8,"33. Now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, Levites;"
Ezra 8,34. By number and by weight of every one: and all the weight was written at that time.
Ezra 8,"35. Also the children of those that had been carried away, which were come out of the captivity, offered burnt offerings unto the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he goats for a sin offering: all this was a burnt offering unto the LORD."
Ezra 8,"36. And they delivered the king's commissions unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors on this side the river: and they furthered the people, and the house of God."
Ezra 9,"1. Now when these things were done, the princes came to me, saying, The people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the people of the lands, doing according to their abominations, even of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites."
Ezra 9,"2. For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for their sons: so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of those lands: yea, the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass."
Ezra 9,"3. And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down astonied."
Ezra 9,"4. Then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the transgression of those that had been carried away; and I sat astonied until the evening sacrifice."
Ezra 9,"5. And at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness; and having rent my garment and my mantle, I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands unto the LORD my God,"
Ezra 9,"6. And said, O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee, my God: for our iniquities are increased over our head, and our trespass is grown up unto the heavens."
Ezra 9,"7. Since the days of our fathers have we been in a great trespass unto this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, and our priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to a spoil, and to confusion of face, as it is this day."
Ezra 9,"8. And now for a little space grace hath been shewed from the LORD our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage."
Ezra 9,"9. For we were bondmen; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our bondage, but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and to repair the desolations thereof, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem."
Ezra 9,"10. And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken thy commandments,"
Ezra 9,"11. Which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets, saying, The land, unto which ye go to possess it, is an unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands, with their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with their uncleanness."
Ezra 9,"12. Now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons, neither take their daughters unto your sons, nor seek their peace or their wealth for ever: that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever."
Ezra 9,"13. And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great trespass, seeing that thou our God hast punished us less than our iniquities deserve, and hast given us such deliverance as this;"
Ezra 9,"14. Should we again break thy commandments, and join in affinity with the people of these abominations? wouldest not thou be angry with us till thou hadst consumed us, so that there should be no remnant nor escaping?"
Ezra 9,"15. O LORD God of Israel, thou art righteous: for we remain yet escaped, as it is this day: behold, we are before thee in our trespasses: for we cannot stand before thee because of this."
Ezra 10,"1. Now when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, there assembled unto him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children: for the people wept very sore."
Ezra 10,"2. And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered and said unto Ezra, We have trespassed against our God, and have taken strange wives of the people of the land: yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing."
Ezra 10,"3. Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law."
Ezra 10,"4. Arise; for this matter belongeth unto thee: we also will be with thee: be of good courage, and do it."
Ezra 10,"5. Then arose Ezra, and made the chief priests, the Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they should do according to this word. And they sware."
Ezra 10,"6. Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib: and when he came thither, he did eat no bread, nor drink water: for he mourned because of the transgression of them that had been carried away."
Ezra 10,"7. And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem;"
Ezra 10,"8. And that whosoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away."
Ezra 10,"9. Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together unto Jerusalem within three days. It was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month; and all the people sat in the street of the house of God, trembling because of this matter, and for the great rain."
Ezra 10,"10. And Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them, Ye have transgressed, and have taken strange wives, to increase the trespass of Israel."
Ezra 10,"11. Now therefore make confession unto the LORD God of your fathers, and do his pleasure: and separate yourselves from the people of the land, and from the strange wives."
Ezra 10,"12. Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice, As thou hast said, so must we do."
Ezra 10,"13. But the people are many, and it is a time of much rain, and we are not able to stand without, neither is this a work of one day or two: for we are many that have transgressed in this thing."
Ezra 10,"14. Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand, and let all them which have taken strange wives in our cities come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath of our God for this matter be turned from us."
Ezra 10,15. Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah were employed about this matter: and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them.
Ezra 10,"16. And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest, with certain chief of the fathers, after the house of their fathers, and all of them by their names, were separated, and sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter."
Ezra 10,17. And they made an end with all the men that had taken strange wives by the first day of the first month.
Ezra 10,"18. And among the sons of the priests there were found that had taken strange wives: namely, of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren; Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah."
Ezra 10,"19. And they gave their hands that they would put away their wives; and being guilty, they offered a ram of the flock for their trespass."
Ezra 10,"20. And of the sons of Immer; Hanani, and Zebadiah."
Ezra 10,"21. And of the sons of Harim; Maaseiah, and Elijah, and Shemaiah, and Jehiel, and Uzziah."
Ezra 10,"22. And of the sons of Pashur; Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethaneel, Jozabad, and Elasah."
Ezra 10,"23. Also of the Levites; Jozabad, and Shimei, and Kelaiah, (the same is Kelita,) Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer."
Ezra 10,"24. Of the singers also; Eliashib: and of the porters; Shallum, and Telem, and Uri."
Ezra 10,"25. Moreover of Israel: of the sons of Parosh; Ramiah, and Jeziah, and Malchiah, and Miamin, and Eleazar, and Malchijah, and Benaiah."
Ezra 10,"26. And of the sons of Elam; Mattaniah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, and Abdi, and Jeremoth, and Eliah."
Ezra 10,"27. And of the sons of Zattu; Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, and Jeremoth, and Zabad, and Aziza."
Ezra 10,"28. Of the sons also of Bebai; Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, and Athlai."
Ezra 10,"29. And of the sons of Bani; Meshullam, Malluch, and Adaiah, Jashub, and Sheal, and Ramoth."
Ezra 10,"30. And of the sons of Pahathmoab; Adna, and Chelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezaleel, and Binnui, and Manasseh."
Ezra 10,"31. And of the sons of Harim; Eliezer, Ishijah, Malchiah, Shemaiah, Shimeon,"
Ezra 10,"32. Benjamin, Malluch, and Shemariah."
Ezra 10,"33. Of the sons of Hashum; Mattenai, Mattathah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh, and Shimei."
Ezra 10,"34. Of the sons of Bani; Maadai, Amram, and Uel,"
Ezra 10,"35. Benaiah, Bedeiah, Chelluh,"
Ezra 10,"36. Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib,"
Ezra 10,"37. Mattaniah, Mattenai, and Jaasau,"
Ezra 10,"38. And Bani, and Binnui, Shimei,"
Ezra 10,"39. And Shelemiah, and Nathan, and Adaiah,"
Ezra 10,"40. Machnadebai, Shashai, Sharai,"
Ezra 10,"41. Azareel, and Shelemiah, Shemariah,"
Ezra 10,"42. Shallum, Amariah, and Joseph."
Ezra 10,"43. Of the sons of Nebo; Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jadau, and Joel, Benaiah."
Ezra 10,44. All these had taken strange wives: and some of them had wives by whom they had children.
Nehemiah 1,"1. The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass in the month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace,"
Nehemiah 1,"2. That Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem."
Nehemiah 1,"3. And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire."
Nehemiah 1,"4. And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven,"
Nehemiah 1,"5. And said, I beseech thee, O LORD God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments:"
Nehemiah 1,"6. Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father's house have sinned."
Nehemiah 1,"7. We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which thou commandedst thy servant Moses."
Nehemiah 1,"8. Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying, If ye transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the nations:"
Nehemiah 1,"9. But if ye turn unto me, and keep my commandments, and do them; though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there."
Nehemiah 1,"10. Now these are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand."
Nehemiah 1,"11. O LORD, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I was the king's cupbearer."
Nehemiah 2,"1. And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that wine was before him: and I took up the wine, and gave it unto the king. Now I had not been beforetime sad in his presence."
Nehemiah 2,"2. Wherefore the king said unto me, Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart. Then I was very sore afraid,"
Nehemiah 2,"3. And said unto the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' sepulchres, lieth waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?"
Nehemiah 2,"4. Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request? So I prayed to the God of heaven."
Nehemiah 2,"5. And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy servant have found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers' sepulchres, that I may build it."
Nehemiah 2,"6. And the king said unto me, (the queen also sitting by him,) For how long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou return? So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time."
Nehemiah 2,"7. Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may convey me over till I come into Judah;"
Nehemiah 2,"8. And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which appertained to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me."
Nehemiah 2,"9. Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me."
Nehemiah 2,"10. When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel."
Nehemiah 2,"11. So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days."
Nehemiah 2,"12. And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem: neither was there any beast with me, save the beast that I rode upon."
Nehemiah 2,"13. And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even before the dragon well, and to the dung port, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates thereof were consumed with fire."
Nehemiah 2,"14. Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the king's pool: but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass."
Nehemiah 2,"15. Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall, and turned back, and entered by the gate of the valley, and so returned."
Nehemiah 2,"16. And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work."
Nehemiah 2,"17. Then said I unto them, Ye see the distress that we are in, how Jerusalem lieth waste, and the gates thereof are burned with fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a reproach."
Nehemiah 2,"18. Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me; as also the king's words that he had spoken unto me. And they said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for this good work."
Nehemiah 2,"19. But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that ye do? will ye rebel against the king?"
Nehemiah 2,"20. Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God of heaven, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build: but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem."
Nehemiah 3,"1. Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests, and they builded the sheep gate; they sanctified it, and set up the doors of it; even unto the tower of Meah they sanctified it, unto the tower of Hananeel."
Nehemiah 3,2. And next unto him builded the men of Jericho. And next to them builded Zaccur the son of Imri.
Nehemiah 3,"3. But the fish gate did the sons of Hassenaah build, who also laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof."
Nehemiah 3,"4. And next unto them repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah, the son of Koz. And next unto them repaired Meshullam the son of Berechiah, the son of Meshezabeel. And next unto them repaired Zadok the son of Baana."
Nehemiah 3,5. And next unto them the Tekoites repaired; but their nobles put not their necks to the work of their LORD.
Nehemiah 3,"6. Moreover the old gate repaired Jehoiada the son of Paseah, and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah; they laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, and the locks thereof, and the bars thereof."
Nehemiah 3,"7. And next unto them repaired Melatiah the Gibeonite, and Jadon the Meronothite, the men of Gibeon, and of Mizpah, unto the throne of the governor on this side the river."
Nehemiah 3,"8. Next unto him repaired Uzziel the son of Harhaiah, of the goldsmiths. Next unto him also repaired Hananiah the son of one of the apothecaries, and they fortified Jerusalem unto the broad wall."
Nehemiah 3,"9. And next unto them repaired Rephaiah the son of Hur, the ruler of the half part of Jerusalem."
Nehemiah 3,"10. And next unto them repaired Jedaiah the son of Harumaph, even over against his house. And next unto him repaired Hattush the son of Hashabniah."
Nehemiah 3,"11. Malchijah the son of Harim, and Hashub the son of Pahathmoab, repaired the other piece, and the tower of the furnaces."
Nehemiah 3,"12. And next unto him repaired Shallum the son of Halohesh, the ruler of the half part of Jerusalem, he and his daughters."
Nehemiah 3,"13. The valley gate repaired Hanun, and the inhabitants of Zanoah; they built it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof, and a thousand cubits on the wall unto the dung gate."
Nehemiah 3,"14. But the dung gate repaired Malchiah the son of Rechab, the ruler of part of Bethhaccerem; he built it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof."
Nehemiah 3,"15. But the gate of the fountain repaired Shallun the son of Colhozeh, the ruler of part of Mizpah; he built it, and covered it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof, and the wall of the pool of Siloah by the king's garden, and unto the stairs that go down from the city of David."
Nehemiah 3,"16. After him repaired Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, the ruler of the half part of Bethzur, unto the place over against the sepulchres of David, and to the pool that was made, and unto the house of the mighty."
Nehemiah 3,"17. After him repaired the Levites, Rehum the son of Bani. Next unto him repaired Hashabiah, the ruler of the half part of Keilah, in his part."
Nehemiah 3,"18. After him repaired their brethren, Bavai the son of Henadad, the ruler of the half part of Keilah."
Nehemiah 3,"19. And next to him repaired Ezer the son of Jeshua, the ruler of Mizpah, another piece over against the going up to the armoury at the turning of the wall."
Nehemiah 3,"20. After him Baruch the son of Zabbai earnestly repaired the other piece, from the turning of the wall unto the door of the house of Eliashib the high priest."
Nehemiah 3,"21. After him repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah the son of Koz another piece, from the door of the house of Eliashib even to the end of the house of Eliashib."
Nehemiah 3,"22. And after him repaired the priests, the men of the plain."
Nehemiah 3,23. After him repaired Benjamin and Hashub over against their house. After him repaired Azariah the son of Maaseiah the son of Ananiah by his house.
Nehemiah 3,"24. After him repaired Binnui the son of Henadad another piece, from the house of Azariah unto the turning of the wall, even unto the corner."
Nehemiah 3,"25. Palal the son of Uzai, over against the turning of the wall, and the tower which lieth out from the king's high house, that was by the court of the prison. After him Pedaiah the son of Parosh."
Nehemiah 3,"26. Moreover the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel, unto the place over against the water gate toward the east, and the tower that lieth out."
Nehemiah 3,"27. After them the Tekoites repaired another piece, over against the great tower that lieth out, even unto the wall of Ophel."
Nehemiah 3,"28. From above the horse gate repaired the priests, every one over against his house."
Nehemiah 3,"29. After them repaired Zadok the son of Immer over against his house. After him repaired also Shemaiah the son of Shechaniah, the keeper of the east gate."

Nehemiah 3,32. And between the going up of the corner unto the sheep gate repaired the goldsmiths and the merchants.
Nehemiah 4,"1. But it came to pass, that when Sanballat heard that we builded the wall, he was wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews."
Nehemiah 4,"2. And he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, What do these feeble Jews? will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned?"
Nehemiah 4,"3. Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that which they build, if a fox go up, he shall even break down their stone wall."
Nehemiah 4,"4. Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn their reproach upon their own head, and give them for a prey in the land of captivity:"
Nehemiah 4,"5. And cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee: for they have provoked thee to anger before the builders."
Nehemiah 4,6. So built we the wall; and all the wall was joined together unto the half thereof: for the people had a mind to work.
Nehemiah 4,"7. But it came to pass, that when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up, and that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth,"
Nehemiah 4,"8. And conspired all of them together to come and to fight against Jerusalem, and to hinder it."
Nehemiah 4,"9. Nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them."
Nehemiah 4,"10. And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall."
Nehemiah 4,"11. And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come in the midst among them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease."
Nehemiah 4,"12. And it came to pass, that when the Jews which dwelt by them came, they said unto us ten times, From all places whence ye shall return unto us they will be upon you."
Nehemiah 4,"13. Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall, and on the higher places, I even set the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows."
Nehemiah 4,"14. And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of them: remember the LORD, which is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses."
Nehemiah 4,"15. And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we returned all of us to the wall, every one unto his work."
Nehemiah 4,"16. And it came to pass from that time forth, that the half of my servants wrought in the work, and the other half of them held both the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the habergeons; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah."
Nehemiah 4,"17. They which builded on the wall, and they that bare burdens, with those that laded, every one with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other hand held a weapon."
Nehemiah 4,"18. For the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and so builded. And he that sounded the trumpet was by me."
Nehemiah 4,"19. And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, The work is great and large, and we are separated upon the wall, one far from another."
Nehemiah 4,"20. In what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet, resort ye thither unto us: our God shall fight for us."
Nehemiah 4,21. So we laboured in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared.
Nehemiah 4,"22. Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and labour on the day."
Nehemiah 4,"23. So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard which followed me, none of us put off our clothes, saving that every one put them off for washing."
Nehemiah 5,1. And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews.
Nehemiah 5,"2. For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters, are many: therefore we take up corn for them, that we may eat, and live."
Nehemiah 5,"3. Some also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands, vineyards, and houses, that we might buy corn, because of the dearth."
Nehemiah 5,"4. There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king's tribute, and that upon our lands and vineyards."
Nehemiah 5,"5. Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought unto bondage already: neither is it in our power to redeem them; for other men have our lands and vineyards."
Nehemiah 5,6. And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.
Nehemiah 5,"7. Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother. And I set a great assembly against them."
Nehemiah 5,"8. And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, which were sold unto the heathen; and will ye even sell your brethren? or shall they be sold unto us? Then held they their peace, and found nothing to answer."
Nehemiah 5,"9. Also I said, It is not good that ye do: ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies?"
Nehemiah 5,"10. I likewise, and my brethren, and my servants, might exact of them money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this usury."
Nehemiah 5,"11. Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them."
Nehemiah 5,"12. Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they should do according to this promise."
Nehemiah 5,"13. Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labour, that performeth not this promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the congregation said, Amen, and praised the LORD. And the people did according to this promise."
Nehemiah 5,"14. Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor."
Nehemiah 5,"15. But the former governors that had been before me were chargeable unto the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, beside forty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants bare rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the fear of God."
Nehemiah 5,"16. Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work."
Nehemiah 5,"17. Moreover there were at my table an hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers, beside those that came unto us from among the heathen that are about us."
Nehemiah 5,"18. Now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this required not I the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people."
Nehemiah 5,"19. Think upon me, my God, for good, according to all that I have done for this people."
Nehemiah 6,"1. Now it came to pass when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had builded the wall, and that there was no breach left therein; (though at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates;)"
Nehemiah 6,"2. That Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in some one of the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief."
Nehemiah 6,"3. And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?"
Nehemiah 6,4. Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.
Nehemiah 6,5. Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand;
Nehemiah 6,"6. Wherein was written, It is reported among the heathen, and Gashmu saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel: for which cause thou buildest the wall, that thou mayest be their king, according to these words."
Nehemiah 6,"7. And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together."
Nehemiah 6,"8. Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart."
Nehemiah 6,"9. For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, O God, strengthen my hands."
Nehemiah 6,"10. Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee."
Nehemiah 6,"11. And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being as I am, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in."
Nehemiah 6,"12. And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him."
Nehemiah 6,"13. Therefore was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me."
Nehemiah 6,"14. My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear."
Nehemiah 6,"15. So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty and two days."
Nehemiah 6,"16. And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard thereof, and all the heathen that were about us saw these things, they were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God."
Nehemiah 6,"17. Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came unto them."
Nehemiah 6,"18. For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah."
Nehemiah 6,"19. Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear."
Nehemiah 7,"1. Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed,"
Nehemiah 7,"2. That I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the palace, charge over Jerusalem: for he was a faithful man, and feared God above many."
Nehemiah 7,"3. And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot; and while they stand by, let them shut the doors, and bar them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one to be over against his house."
Nehemiah 7,"4. Now the city was large and great: but the people were few therein, and the houses were not builded."
Nehemiah 7,"5. And my God put into mine heart to gather together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I found a register of the genealogy of them which came up at the first, and found written therein,"
Nehemiah 7,"6. These are the children of the province, that went up out of the captivity, of those that had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and came again to Jerusalem and to Judah, every one unto his city;"

Nehemiah 8,"1. And all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the street that was before the water gate; and they spake unto Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the LORD had commanded to Israel."
Nehemiah 8,"2. And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both of men and women, and all that could hear with understanding, upon the first day of the seventh month."
Nehemiah 8,"3. And he read therein before the street that was before the water gate from the morning until midday, before the men and the women, and those that could understand; and the ears of all the people were attentive unto the book of the law."
Nehemiah 8,"4. And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood, which they had made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, and Shema, and Anaiah, and Urijah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchiah, and Hashum, and Hashbadana, Zechariah, and Meshullam."
Nehemiah 8,"5. And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people; (for he was above all the people;) and when he opened it, all the people stood up:"
Nehemiah 8,"6. And Ezra blessed the LORD, the great God. And all the people answered, Amen, Amen, with lifting up their hands: and they bowed their heads, and worshipped the LORD with their faces to the ground."

Nehemiah 8,"8. So they read in the book in the law of God distinctly, and gave the sense, and caused them to understand the reading."
Nehemiah 8,"9. And Nehemiah, which is the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said unto all the people, This day is holy unto the LORD your God; mourn not, nor weep. For all the people wept, when they heard the words of the law."
Nehemiah 8,"10. Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared: for this day is holy unto our LORD: neither be ye sorry; for the joy of the LORD is your strength."
Nehemiah 8,"11. So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your peace, for the day is holy; neither be ye grieved."
Nehemiah 8,"12. And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great mirth, because they had understood the words that were declared unto them."
Nehemiah 8,"13. And on the second day were gathered together the chief of the fathers of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, unto Ezra the scribe, even to understand the words of the law."
Nehemiah 8,"14. And they found written in the law which the LORD had commanded by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month:"
Nehemiah 8,"15. And that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth unto the mount, and fetch olive branches, and pine branches, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as it is written."
Nehemiah 8,"16. So the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves booths, every one upon the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the street of the water gate, and in the street of the gate of Ephraim."
Nehemiah 8,"17. And all the congregation of them that were come again out of the captivity made booths, and sat under the booths: for since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun unto that day had not the children of Israel done so. And there was very great gladness."
Nehemiah 8,"18. Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read in the book of the law of God. And they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly, according unto the manner."
Nehemiah 9,"1. Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting, and with sackclothes, and earth upon them."

Nehemiah 9,"3. And they stood up in their place, and read in the book of the law of the LORD their God one fourth part of the day; and another fourth part they confessed, and worshipped the LORD their God."
Nehemiah 9,"4. Then stood up upon the stairs, of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani, and cried with a loud voice unto the LORD their God."
Nehemiah 9,"5. Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, Sherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said, Stand up and bless the LORD your God for ever and ever: and blessed be thy glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise."
Nehemiah 9,"6. Thou, even thou, art LORD alone; thou hast made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth, and all things that are therein, the seas, and all that is therein, and thou preservest them all; and the host of heaven worshippeth thee."
Nehemiah 9,"7. Thou art the LORD the God, who didst choose Abram, and broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gavest him the name of Abraham;"
Nehemiah 9,"8. And foundest his heart faithful before thee, and madest a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites, and the Girgashites, to give it, I say, to his seed, and hast performed thy words; for thou art righteous:"
Nehemiah 9,"9. And didst see the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heardest their cry by the Red sea;"
Nehemiah 9,"10. And shewedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land: for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them. So didst thou get thee a name, as it is this day."
Nehemiah 9,"11. And thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their persecutors thou threwest into the deeps, as a stone into the mighty waters."
Nehemiah 9,"12. Moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and in the night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in the way wherein they should go."
Nehemiah 9,"13. Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them from heaven, and gavest them right judgments, and true laws, good statutes and commandments:"
Nehemiah 9,"14. And madest known unto them thy holy sabbath, and commandedst them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses thy servant:"
Nehemiah 9,"15. And gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger, and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and promisedst them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give them."
Nehemiah 9,"16. But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their necks, and hearkened not to thy commandments,"
Nehemiah 9,"17. And refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them; but hardened their necks, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage: but thou art a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and forsookest them not."
Nehemiah 9,"18. Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is thy God that brought thee up out of Egypt, and had wrought great provocations;"
Nehemiah 9,"19. Yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness: the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to shew them light, and the way wherein they should go."
Nehemiah 9,"20. Thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them, and withheldest not thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them water for their thirst."
Nehemiah 9,"21. Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness, so that they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and their feet swelled not."
Nehemiah 9,"22. Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations, and didst divide them into corners: so they possessed the land of Sihon, and the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan."
Nehemiah 9,"23. Their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven, and broughtest them into the land, concerning which thou hadst promised to their fathers, that they should go in to possess it."
Nehemiah 9,"24. So the children went in and possessed the land, and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gavest them into their hands, with their kings, and the people of the land, that they might do with them as they would."
Nehemiah 9,"25. And they took strong cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all goods, wells digged, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit trees in abundance: so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy great goodness."
Nehemiah 9,"26. Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast thy law behind their backs, and slew thy prophets which testified against them to turn them to thee, and they wrought great provocations."
Nehemiah 9,"27. Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemies, who vexed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto thee, thou heardest them from heaven; and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours, who saved them out of the hand of their enemies."
Nehemiah 9,"28. But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee: therefore leftest thou them in the land of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried unto thee, thou heardest them from heaven; and many times didst thou deliver them according to thy mercies;"
Nehemiah 9,"29. And testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them again unto thy law: yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not unto thy commandments, but sinned against thy judgments, (which if a man do, he shall live in them;) and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear."
Nehemiah 9,"30. Yet many years didst thou forbear them, and testifiedst against them by thy spirit in thy prophets: yet would they not give ear: therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the people of the lands."
Nehemiah 9,"31. Nevertheless for thy great mercies' sake thou didst not utterly consume them, nor forsake them; for thou art a gracious and merciful God."
Nehemiah 9,"32. Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who keepest covenant and mercy, let not all the trouble seem little before thee, that hath come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all thy people, since the time of the kings of Assyria unto this day."
Nehemiah 9,"33. Howbeit thou art just in all that is brought upon us; for thou hast done right, but we have done wickedly:"
Nehemiah 9,"34. Neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept thy law, nor hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies, wherewith thou didst testify against them."
Nehemiah 9,"35. For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy great goodness that thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land which thou gavest before them, neither turned they from their wicked works."
Nehemiah 9,"36. Behold, we are servants this day, and for the land that thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof, behold, we are servants in it:"
Nehemiah 9,"37. And it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins: also they have dominion over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress."
Nehemiah 9,"38. And because of all this we make a sure covenant, and write it; and our princes, Levites, and priests, seal unto it."

Nehemiah 10,"29. They clave to their brethren, their nobles, and entered into a curse, and into an oath, to walk in God's law, which was given by Moses the servant of God, and to observe and do all the commandments of the LORD our Lord, and his judgments and his statutes;"
Nehemiah 10,"30. And that we would not give our daughters unto the people of the land, not take their daughters for our sons:"
Nehemiah 10,"31. And if the people of the land bring ware or any victuals on the sabbath day to sell, that we would not buy it of them on the sabbath, or on the holy day: and that we would leave the seventh year, and the exaction of every debt."
Nehemiah 10,"32. Also we made ordinances for us, to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our God;"

Nehemiah 10,"39. For the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall bring the offering of the corn, of the new wine, and the oil, unto the chambers, where are the vessels of the sanctuary, and the priests that minister, and the porters, and the singers: and we will not forsake the house of our God."

Nehemiah 12,"29. Also from the house of Gilgal, and out of the fields of Geba and Azmaveth: for the singers had builded them villages round about Jerusalem."
Nehemiah 12,"30. And the priests and the Levites purified themselves, and purified the people, and the gates, and the wall."
Nehemiah 12,"31. Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall, and appointed two great companies of them that gave thanks, whereof one went on the right hand upon the wall toward the dung gate:"
Nehemiah 12,"32. And after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah,"
Nehemiah 12,"33. And Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,"
Nehemiah 12,"34. Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah,"
Nehemiah 12,"35. And certain of the priests' sons with trumpets; namely, Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Michaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph:"
Nehemiah 12,"36. And his brethren, Shemaiah, and Azarael, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethaneel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God, and Ezra the scribe before them."
Nehemiah 12,"37. And at the fountain gate, which was over against them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the going up of the wall, above the house of David, even unto the water gate eastward."
Nehemiah 12,"38. And the other company of them that gave thanks went over against them, and I after them, and the half of the people upon the wall, from beyond the tower of the furnaces even unto the broad wall;"
Nehemiah 12,"39. And from above the gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate, and above the fish gate, and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of Meah, even unto the sheep gate: and they stood still in the prison gate."
Nehemiah 12,"40. So stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the house of God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me:"
Nehemiah 12,"41. And the priests; Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Michaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets;"
Nehemiah 12,"42. And Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer."
Nehemiah 12,"43. Also that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced: for God had made them rejoice with great joy: the wives also and the children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off."
Nehemiah 12,"44. And at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the treasures, for the offerings, for the firstfruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of the law for the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that waited."
Nehemiah 12,"45. And both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their God, and the ward of the purification, according to the commandment of David, and of Solomon his son."
Nehemiah 12,"46. For in the days of David and Asaph of old there were chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God."
Nehemiah 12,"47. And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, every day his portion: and they sanctified holy things unto the Levites; and the Levites sanctified them unto the children of Aaron."
Nehemiah 13,"1. On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people; and therein was found written, that the Ammonite and the Moabite should not come into the congregation of God for ever;"
Nehemiah 13,"2. Because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Balaam against them, that he should curse them: howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing."
Nehemiah 13,"3. Now it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude."
Nehemiah 13,"4. And before this, Eliashib the priest, having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our God, was allied unto Tobiah:"
Nehemiah 13,"5. And he had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime they laid the meat offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the corn, the new wine, and the oil, which was commanded to be given to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the offerings of the priests."
Nehemiah 13,"6. But in all this time was not I at Jerusalem: for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon came I unto the king, and after certain days obtained I leave of the king:"
Nehemiah 13,"7. And I came to Jerusalem, and understood of the evil that Eliashib did for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God."
Nehemiah 13,8. And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household stuff to Tobiah out of the chamber.
Nehemiah 13,"9. Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meat offering and the frankincense."
Nehemiah 13,"10. And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them: for the Levites and the singers, that did the work, were fled every one to his field."
Nehemiah 13,"11. Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in their place."
Nehemiah 13,12. Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuries.
Nehemiah 13,"13. And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah: for they were counted faithful, and their office was to distribute unto their brethren."
Nehemiah 13,"14. Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the offices thereof."
Nehemiah 13,"15. In those days saw I in Judah some treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified against them in the day wherein they sold victuals."
Nehemiah 13,"16. There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish, and all manner of ware, and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem."
Nehemiah 13,"17. Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day?"
Nehemiah 13,"18. Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath."
Nehemiah 13,"19. And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of my servants set I at the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day."
Nehemiah 13,20. So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without Jerusalem once or twice.
Nehemiah 13,"21. Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath."
Nehemiah 13,"22. And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember me, O my God, concerning this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy."
Nehemiah 13,"23. In those days also saw I Jews that had married wives of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab:"
Nehemiah 13,"24. And their children spake half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews' language, but according to the language of each people."
Nehemiah 13,"25. And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, saying, Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters unto your sons, or for yourselves."
Nehemiah 13,"26. Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did outlandish women cause to sin."
Nehemiah 13,"27. Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to transgress against our God in marrying strange wives?"
Nehemiah 13,"28. And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son in law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me."
Nehemiah 13,"29. Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites."
Nehemiah 13,"30. Thus cleansed I them from all strangers, and appointed the wards of the priests and the Levites, every one in his business;"
Nehemiah 13,"31. And for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the firstfruits. Remember me, O my God, for good."
Esther 1,"1. Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this is Ahasuerus which reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia, over an hundred and seven and twenty provinces:)"
Esther 1,"2. That in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace,"
Esther 1,"3. In the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him:"
Esther 1,"4. When he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days, even an hundred and fourscore days."
Esther 1,"5. And when these days were expired, the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both unto great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king's palace;"
Esther 1,"6. Where were white, green, and blue, hangings, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the beds were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue, and white, and black, marble."
Esther 1,"7. And they gave them drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels being diverse one from another,) and royal wine in abundance, according to the state of the king."
Esther 1,"8. And the drinking was according to the law; none did compel: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man's pleasure."
Esther 1,9. Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.
Esther 1,"10. On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,"
Esther 1,"11. To bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to shew the people and the princes her beauty: for she was fair to look on."
Esther 1,"12. But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by his chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger burned in him."
Esther 1,"13. Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times, (for so was the king's manner toward all that knew law and judgment:"
Esther 1,"14. And the next unto him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, which saw the king's face, and which sat the first in the kingdom;)"
Esther 1,"15. What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, because she hath not performed the commandment of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?"
Esther 1,"16. And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the people that are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus."
Esther 1,"17. For this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women, so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes, when it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not."
Esther 1,"18. Likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto all the king's princes, which have heard of the deed of the queen. Thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath."
Esther 1,"19. If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she."
Esther 1,"20. And when the king's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all the wives shall give to their husbands honour, both to great and small."
Esther 1,21. And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan:
Esther 1,"22. For he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and that it should be published according to the language of every people."
Esther 2,"1. After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her."
Esther 2,"2. Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king:"
Esther 2,"3. And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hege the king's chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for purification be given them:"
Esther 2,4. And let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.
Esther 2,"5. Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite;"
Esther 2,"6. Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away."
Esther 2,"7. And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid was fair and beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her father and mother were dead, took for his own daughter."
Esther 2,"8. So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also unto the king's house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women."
Esther 2,"9. And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with such things as belonged to her, and seven maidens, which were meet to be given her, out of the king's house: and he preferred her and her maids unto the best place of the house of the women."
Esther 2,10. Esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai had charged her that she should not shew it.
Esther 2,"11. And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her."
Esther 2,"12. Now when every maid's turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the women, (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, to wit, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odours, and with other things for the purifying of the women;)"
Esther 2,13. Then thus came every maiden unto the king; whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king's house.
Esther 2,"14. In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's chamberlain, which kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and that she were called by name."
Esther 2,"15. Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her."
Esther 2,"16. So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign."
Esther 2,"17. And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti."
Esther 2,"18. Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, even Esther's feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the state of the king."
Esther 2,"19. And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai sat in the king's gate."
Esther 2,"20. Esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him."
Esther 2,"21. In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, two of the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hands on the king Ahasuerus."
Esther 2,"22. And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told it unto Esther the queen; and Esther certified the king thereof in Mordecai's name."
Esther 2,"23. And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out; therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king."
Esther 3,"1. After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that were with him."
Esther 3,"2. And all the king's servants, that were in the king's gate, bowed, and reverenced Haman: for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence."
Esther 3,"3. Then the king's servants, which were in the king's gate, said unto Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the king's commandment?"
Esther 3,"4. Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai's matters would stand: for he had told them that he was a Jew."
Esther 3,"5. And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence, then was Haman full of wrath."
Esther 3,"6. And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had shewed him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai."
Esther 3,"7. In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar."
Esther 3,"8. And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from all people; neither keep they the king's laws: therefore it is not for the king's profit to suffer them."
Esther 3,"9. If it please the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business, to bring it into the king's treasuries."
Esther 3,"10. And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews' enemy."
Esther 3,"11. And the king said unto Haman, The silver is given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee."
Esther 3,"12. Then were the king's scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and there was written according to all that Haman had commanded unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors that were over every province, and to the rulers of every people of every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and sealed with the king's ring."
Esther 3,"13. And the letters were sent by posts into all the king's provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey."
Esther 3,"14. The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people, that they should be ready against that day."
Esther 3,"15. The posts went out, being hastened by the king's commandment, and the decree was given in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city Shushan was perplexed."
Esther 4,"1. When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;"
Esther 4,2. And came even before the king's gate: for none might enter into the king's gate clothed with sackcloth.
Esther 4,"3. And in every province, whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes."
Esther 4,"4. So Esther's maids and her chamberlains came and told it her. Then was the queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him: but he received it not."
Esther 4,"5. Then called Esther for Hatach, one of the king's chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a commandment to Mordecai, to know what it was, and why it was."
Esther 4,"6. So Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city, which was before the king's gate."
Esther 4,"7. And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them."
Esther 4,"8. Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at Shushan to destroy them, to shew it unto Esther, and to declare it unto her, and to charge her that she should go in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to make request before him for her people."
Esther 4,9. And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.
Esther 4,"10. Again Esther spake unto Hatach, and gave him commandment unto Mordecai;"
Esther 4,"11. All the king's servants, and the people of the king's provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or women, shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law of his to put him to death, except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live: but I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days."
Esther 4,12. And they told to Mordecai Esther's words.
Esther 4,"13. Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house, more than all the Jews."
Esther 4,"14. For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed: and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?"
Esther 4,"15. Then Esther bade them return Mordecai this answer,"
Esther 4,"16. Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish."
Esther 4,"17. So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him."
Esther 5,"1. Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king's house, over against the king's house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over against the gate of the house."
Esther 5,"2. And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favour in his sight: and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre."
Esther 5,"3. Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and what is thy request? it shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdom."
Esther 5,"4. And Esther answered, If it seem good unto the king, let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him."
Esther 5,"5. Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared."
Esther 5,"6. And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed."
Esther 5,"7. Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request is;"
Esther 5,"8. If I have found favour in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do to morrow as the king hath said."
Esther 5,"9. Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart: but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he stood not up, nor moved for him, he was full of indignation against Mordecai."
Esther 5,"10. Nevertheless Haman refrained himself: and when he came home, he sent and called for his friends, and Zeresh his wife."
Esther 5,"11. And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things wherein the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king."
Esther 5,"12. Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to morrow am I invited unto her also with the king."
Esther 5,"13. Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate."
Esther 5,"14. Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and to morrow speak thou unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made."
Esther 6,"1. On that night could not the king sleep, and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles; and they were read before the king."
Esther 6,"2. And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's chamberlains, the keepers of the door, who sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus."
Esther 6,"3. And the king said, What honour and dignity hath been done to Mordecai for this? Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, There is nothing done for him."
Esther 6,"4. And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman was come into the outward court of the king's house, to speak unto the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him."
Esther 6,"5. And the king's servants said unto him, Behold, Haman standeth in the court. And the king said, Let him come in."
Esther 6,"6. So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour? Now Haman thought in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honour more than to myself?"
Esther 6,"7. And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king delighteth to honour,"
Esther 6,"8. Let the royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear, and the horse that the king rideth upon, and the crown royal which is set upon his head:"
Esther 6,"9. And let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble princes, that they may array the man withal whom the king delighteth to honour, and bring him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honour."
Esther 6,"10. Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel and the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that sitteth at the king's gate: let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken."
Esther 6,"11. Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and brought him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour."
Esther 6,"12. And Mordecai came again to the king's gate. But Haman hasted to his house mourning, and having his head covered."
Esther 6,"13. And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto him, If Mordecai be of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt surely fall before him."
Esther 6,"14. And while they were yet talking with him, came the king's chamberlains, and hasted to bring Haman unto the banquet that Esther had prepared."
Esther 7,1. So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.
Esther 7,"2. And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition, queen Esther? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? and it shall be performed, even to the half of the kingdom."
Esther 7,"3. Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favour in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request:"
Esther 7,"4. For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my tongue, although the enemy could not countervail the king's damage."
Esther 7,"5. Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart to do so?"
Esther 7,"6. And Esther said, The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman. Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen."
Esther 7,7. And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath went into the palace garden: and Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king.
Esther 7,"8. Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the bed whereon Esther was. Then said the king, Will he force the queen also before me in the house? As the word went out of king's mouth, they covered Haman's face."
Esther 7,"9. And Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said before the king, Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman had made for Mordecai, who spoken good for the king, standeth in the house of Haman. Then the king said, Hang him thereon."
Esther 7,10. So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then was the king's wrath pacified.
Esther 8,1. On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jews' enemy unto Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what he was unto her.
Esther 8,"2. And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman."
Esther 8,"3. And Esther spake yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews."
Esther 8,"4. Then the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther. So Esther arose, and stood before the king,"
Esther 8,"5. And said, If it please the king, and if I have favour in his sight, and the thing seem right before the king, and I be pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews which are in all the king's provinces:"
Esther 8,6. For how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?
Esther 8,"7. Then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid his hand upon the Jews."
Esther 8,"8. Write ye also for the Jews, as it liketh you, in the king's name, and seal it with the king's ring: for the writing which is written in the king's name, and sealed with the king's ring, may no man reverse."
Esther 8,"9. Then were the king's scribes called at that time in the third month, that is, the month Sivan, on the three and twentieth day thereof; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded unto the Jews, and to the lieutenants, and the deputies and rulers of the provinces which are from India unto Ethiopia, an hundred twenty and seven provinces, unto every province according to the writing thereof, and unto every people after their language, and to the Jews according to their writing, and according to their language."
Esther 8,"10. And he wrote in the king Ahasuerus' name, and sealed it with the king's ring, and sent letters by posts on horseback, and riders on mules, camels, and young dromedaries:"
Esther 8,"11. Wherein the king granted the Jews which were in every city to gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to slay and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that would assault them, both little ones and women, and to take the spoil of them for a prey,"
Esther 8,"12. Upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, namely, upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar."
Esther 8,"13. The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people, and that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies."
Esther 8,"14. So the posts that rode upon mules and camels went out, being hastened and pressed on by the king's commandment. And the decree was given at Shushan the palace."
Esther 8,"15. And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a garment of fine linen and purple: and the city of Shushan rejoiced and was glad."
Esther 8,"16. The Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and honour."
Esther 8,"17. And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness, a feast and a good day. And many of the people of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews fell upon them."
Esther 9,"1. Now in the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king's commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution, in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them, (though it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over them that hated them;)"
Esther 9,"2. The Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their hurt: and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them fell upon all people."
Esther 9,"3. And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and the deputies, and officers of the king, helped the Jews; because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them."
Esther 9,"4. For Mordecai was great in the king's house, and his fame went out throughout all the provinces: for this man Mordecai waxed greater and greater."
Esther 9,"5. Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and slaughter, and destruction, and did what they would unto those that hated them."
Esther 9,6. And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men.
Esther 9,"7. And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha,"
Esther 9,"8. And Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,"
Esther 9,"9. And Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vajezatha,"
Esther 9,"10. The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews, slew they; but on the spoil laid they not their hand."
Esther 9,11. On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the palace was brought before the king.
Esther 9,"12. And the king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the ten sons of Haman; what have they done in the rest of the king's provinces? now what is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: or what is thy request further? and it shall be done."
Esther 9,"13. Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews which are in Shushan to do to morrow also according unto this day's decree, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged upon the gallows."
Esther 9,14. And the king commanded it so to be done: and the decree was given at Shushan; and they hanged Haman's ten sons.
Esther 9,"15. For the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three hundred men at Shushan; but on the prey they laid not their hand."
Esther 9,"16. But the other Jews that were in the king's provinces gathered themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest from their enemies, and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand, but they laid not their hands on the prey,"
Esther 9,"17. On the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same rested they, and made it a day of feasting and gladness."
Esther 9,"18. But the Jews that were at Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth day thereof, and on the fourteenth thereof; and on the fifteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness."
Esther 9,"19. Therefore the Jews of the villages, that dwelt in the unwalled towns, made the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions one to another."
Esther 9,"20. And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the Jews that were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both nigh and far,"
Esther 9,"21. To stablish this among them, that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly,"
Esther 9,"22. As the days wherein the Jews rested from their enemies, and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy, and from mourning into a good day: that they should make them days of feasting and joy, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor."
Esther 9,"23. And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had written unto them;"
Esther 9,"24. Because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had devised against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is, the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them;"
Esther 9,"25. But when Esther came before the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he devised against the Jews, should return upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows."
Esther 9,"26. Wherefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur. Therefore for all the words of this letter, and of that which they had seen concerning this matter, and which had come unto them,"
Esther 9,"27. The Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all such as joined themselves unto them, so as it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to their writing, and according to their appointed time every year;"
Esther 9,"28. And that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the memorial of them perish from their seed."
Esther 9,"29. Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority, to confirm this second letter of Purim."
Esther 9,"30. And he sent the letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and truth,"
Esther 9,"31. To confirm these days of Purim in their times appointed, according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them, and as they had decreed for themselves and for their seed, the matters of the fastings and their cry."
Esther 9,32. And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book.
Esther 10,"1. And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land, and upon the isles of the sea."
Esther 10,"2. And all the acts of his power and of his might, and the declaration of the greatness of Mordecai, whereunto the king advanced him, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?"
Esther 10,"3. For Mordecai the Jew was next unto king Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, and accepted of the multitude of his brethren, seeking the wealth of his people, and speaking peace to all his seed."
Job 1,"1. There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil."
Job 1,2. And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.
Job 1,"3. His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east."
Job 1,"4. And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them."
Job 1,"5. And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually."
Job 1,"6. Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them."
Job 1,"7. And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it."
Job 1,"8. And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?"
Job 1,"9. Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?"
Job 1,"10. Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land."
Job 1,"11. But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face."
Job 1,"12. And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD."
Job 1,13. And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:
Job 1,"14. And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:"
Job 1,"15. And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee."
Job 1,"16. While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee."
Job 1,"17. While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee."
Job 1,"18. While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:"
Job 1,"19. And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee."
Job 1,"20. Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,"
Job 1,"21. And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD."
Job 1,"22. In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly."
Job 2,"1. Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD."
Job 2,"2. And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it."
Job 2,"3. And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause."
Job 2,"4. And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life."
Job 2,"5. But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face."
Job 2,"6. And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but save his life."
Job 2,"7. So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown."
Job 2,8. And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes.
Job 2,"9. Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God, and die."
Job 2,"10. But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips."
Job 2,"11. Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him."
Job 2,"12. And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven."
Job 2,"13. So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his grief was very great."
Job 3,"1. After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day."
Job 3,"2. And Job spake, and said,"
Job 3,"3. Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a man child conceived."
Job 3,"4. Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it."
Job 3,5. Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.
Job 3,"6. As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months."
Job 3,"7. Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein."
Job 3,"8. Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning."
Job 3,"9. Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:"
Job 3,"10. Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes."
Job 3,11. Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?
Job 3,12. Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?
Job 3,"13. For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,"
Job 3,"14. With kings and counsellors of the earth, which build desolate places for themselves;"
Job 3,"15. Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:"
Job 3,16. Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light.
Job 3,17. There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest.
Job 3,18. There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.
Job 3,19. The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master.
Job 3,"20. Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter in soul;"
Job 3,"21. Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;"
Job 3,"22. Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave?"
Job 3,"23. Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?"
Job 3,"24. For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters."
Job 3,"25. For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me."
Job 3,"26. I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came."
Job 4,"1. Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,"
Job 4,"2. If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?"
Job 4,"3. Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands."
Job 4,"4. Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees."
Job 4,"5. But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled."
Job 4,"6. Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?"
Job 4,"7. Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?"
Job 4,"8. Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same."
Job 4,"9. By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed."
Job 4,"10. The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken."
Job 4,"11. The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad."
Job 4,"12. Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof."
Job 4,"13. In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men,"
Job 4,"14. Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake."
Job 4,15. Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:
Job 4,"16. It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying,"
Job 4,17. Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?
Job 4,"18. Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:"
Job 4,"19. How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth?"
Job 4,20. They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding it.
Job 4,"21. Doth not their excellency which is in them go away? they die, even without wisdom."
Job 5,"1. Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn?"
Job 5,"2. For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one."
Job 5,3. I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation.
Job 5,"4. His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither is there any to deliver them."
Job 5,"5. Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance."
Job 5,"6. Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;"
Job 5,"7. Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward."
Job 5,"8. I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause:"
Job 5,9. Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without number:
Job 5,"10. Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields:"

Job 10,16. For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me.
Job 10,"17. Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine indignation upon me; changes and war are against me."
Job 10,"18. Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me!"

Job 11,"1. Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,"
Job 11,2. Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talk be justified?

Job 11,"4. For thou hast said, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in thine eyes."
Job 11,"5. But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee;"
Job 11,"6. And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, that they are double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth."
Job 11,7. Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?
Job 11,8. It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know?

Job 11,"12. For vain men would be wise, though man be born like a wild ass's colt."
Job 11,"13. If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward him;"
Job 11,"14. If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles."
Job 11,"15. For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear:"

Job 28,10. He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every precious thing.
Job 28,11. He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light.
Job 28,12. But where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of understanding?

Job 28,"22. Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with our ears."
Job 28,"23. God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof."
Job 28,"24. For he looketh to the ends of the earth, and seeth under the whole heaven;"
Job 28,25. To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters by measure.
Job 28,"26. When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder:"
Job 28,"27. Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and searched it out."
Job 28,"28. And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the LORD, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding."
Job 29,"1. Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,"
Job 29,"2. Oh that I were as in months past, as in the days when God preserved me;"
Job 29,"3. When his candle shined upon my head, and when by his light I walked through darkness;"

Job 29,"5. When the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were about me;"

Job 29,"12. Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and him that had none to help him."
Job 29,13. The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.

Job 29,"24. If I laughed on them, they believed it not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down."

Job 30,"5. They were driven forth from among men, (they cried after them as after a thief;)"
Job 30,"6. To dwell in the cliffs of the valleys, in caves of the earth, and in the rocks."
Job 30,7. Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered together.

Job 31,2. For what portion of God is there from above? and what inheritance of the Almighty from on high?
Job 31,3. Is not destruction to the wicked? and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity?
Job 31,"4. Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps?"
Job 31,"5. If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to deceit;"
Job 31,6. Let me be weighed in an even balance that God may know mine integrity.
Job 31,"7. If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands;"

Job 31,"14. What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?"
Job 31,15. Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb?

Job 31,"26. If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness;"

Job 31,"35. Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire is, that the Almighty would answer me, and that mine adversary had written a book."
Job 31,"36. Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a crown to me."
Job 31,37. I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him.
Job 31,"38. If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise thereof complain;"
Job 31,"39. If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life:"
Job 31,"40. Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended."
Job 32,"1. So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes."
Job 32,"2. Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God."
Job 32,"3. Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job."
Job 32,"4. Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he."
Job 32,"5. When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, then his wrath was kindled."
Job 32,"6. And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion."
Job 32,"7. I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom."
Job 32,8. But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.
Job 32,9. Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand judgment.
Job 32,"10. Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion."
Job 32,"11. Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say."
Job 32,"12. Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you that convinced Job, or that answered his words:"
Job 32,"13. Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man."
Job 32,14. Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches.
Job 32,"15. They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking."
Job 32,"16. When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and answered no more;)"
Job 32,"17. I said, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion."
Job 32,"18. For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me."
Job 32,"19. Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles."
Job 32,"20. I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer."
Job 32,"21. Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man."
Job 32,22. For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my maker would soon take me away.
Job 33,"1. Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my words."
Job 33,"2. Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth."
Job 33,3. My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly.
Job 33,"4. The spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life."
Job 33,"5. If thou canst answer me, set thy words in order before me, stand up."
Job 33,"6. Behold, I am according to thy wish in God's stead: I also am formed out of the clay."
Job 33,"7. Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee."
Job 33,"8. Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words, saying,"
Job 33,"9. I am clean without transgression, I am innocent; neither is there iniquity in me."
Job 33,"10. Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy,"
Job 33,"11. He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths."
Job 33,"12. Behold, in this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man."
Job 33,13. Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters.
Job 33,"14. For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not."
Job 33,"15. In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;"
Job 33,"16. Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction,"
Job 33,"17. That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man."
Job 33,"18. He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword."
Job 33,"19. He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain:"
Job 33,"20. So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat."
Job 33,"21. His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen stick out."
Job 33,"22. Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers."
Job 33,"23. If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness:"
Job 33,"24. Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom."
Job 33,25. His flesh shall be fresher than a child's: he shall return to the days of his youth:
Job 33,"26. He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness."
Job 33,"27. He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not;"
Job 33,"28. He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light."
Job 33,"29. Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man,"
Job 33,"30. To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living."
Job 33,"31. Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak."
Job 33,"32. If thou hast anything to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee."
Job 33,"33. If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom."
Job 34,"1. Furthermore Elihu answered and said,"
Job 34,"2. Hear my words, O ye wise men; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge."
Job 34,"3. For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat."
Job 34,4. Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what is good.
Job 34,"5. For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment."
Job 34,6. Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without transgression.
Job 34,"7. What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?"
Job 34,"8. Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men."
Job 34,"9. For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God."
Job 34,"10. Therefore hearken unto me ye men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity."
Job 34,"11. For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to his ways."
Job 34,"12. Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment."
Job 34,13. Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?
Job 34,"14. If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;"
Job 34,"15. All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust."
Job 34,"16. If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words."
Job 34,17. Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just?
Job 34,"18. Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked? and to princes, Ye are ungodly?"
Job 34,"19. How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all are the work of his hands."
Job 34,"20. In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand."
Job 34,"21. For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings."
Job 34,"22. There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves."
Job 34,23. For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should enter into judgment with God.
Job 34,"24. He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead."
Job 34,"25. Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed."
Job 34,26. He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;
Job 34,"27. Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:"
Job 34,"28. So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted."
Job 34,"29. When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only:"
Job 34,"30. That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared."
Job 34,"31. Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more:"
Job 34,"32. That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more."
Job 34,"33. Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest."
Job 34,"34. Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me."
Job 34,"35. Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom."
Job 34,36. My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men.
Job 34,"37. For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands among us, and multiplieth his words against God."
Job 35,"1. Elihu spake moreover, and said,"
Job 35,"2. Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My righteousness is more than God's?"
Job 35,"3. For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? and, What profit shall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin?"
Job 35,"4. I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee."
Job 35,"5. Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which are higher than thou."
Job 35,"6. If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?"
Job 35,"7. If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand?"
Job 35,8. Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy righteousness may profit the son of man.
Job 35,9. By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.
Job 35,"10. But none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the night;"
Job 35,"11. Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?"
Job 35,"12. There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men."
Job 35,"13. Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it."
Job 35,"14. Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is before him; therefore trust thou in him."
Job 35,"15. But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger; yet he knoweth it not in great extremity:"
Job 35,16. Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge.
Job 36,"1. Elihu also proceeded, and said,"
Job 36,"2. Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I have yet to speak on God's behalf."
Job 36,"3. I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker."
Job 36,4. For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.
Job 36,"5. Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength and wisdom."
Job 36,6. He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor.
Job 36,"7. He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted."
Job 36,"8. And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of affliction;"
Job 36,"9. Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded."
Job 36,"10. He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity."
Job 36,"11. If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures."
Job 36,"12. But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge."
Job 36,13. But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them.
Job 36,"14. They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean."
Job 36,"15. He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression."
Job 36,"16. Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness."
Job 36,17. But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold on thee.
Job 36,"18. Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee."
Job 36,"19. Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of strength."
Job 36,"20. Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place."
Job 36,"21. Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction."
Job 36,"22. Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?"
Job 36,"23. Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?"
Job 36,"24. Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold."
Job 36,25. Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off.
Job 36,"26. Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out."
Job 36,27. For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof:
Job 36,28. Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly.
Job 36,"29. Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the noise of his tabernacle?"
Job 36,"30. Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea."
Job 36,31. For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance.
Job 36,32. With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt.
Job 36,"33. The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour."
Job 37,"1. At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his place."
Job 37,"2. Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that goeth out of his mouth."
Job 37,"3. He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth."
Job 37,4. After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.
Job 37,"5. God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend."
Job 37,"6. For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth; likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength."
Job 37,7. He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work.
Job 37,"8. Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places."
Job 37,9. Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north.
Job 37,10. By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened.
Job 37,11. Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his bright cloud:
Job 37,12. And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth.
Job 37,"13. He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy."
Job 37,"14. Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God."
Job 37,"15. Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine?"
Job 37,"16. Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge?"

Ecclesiastes 9,"13. This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it seemed great unto me:"
Ecclesiastes 9,"14. There was a little city, and few men within it; and there came a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it:"

Jeremiah 23,"10. For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing the land mourneth; the pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up, and their course is evil, and their force is not right."
Jeremiah 23,"11. For both prophet and priest are profane; yea, in my house have I found their wickedness, saith the LORD."
Jeremiah 23,"12. Wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery ways in the darkness: they shall be driven on, and fall therein: for I will bring evil upon them, even the year of their visitation, saith the LORD."
Jeremiah 23,"13. And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied in Baal, and caused my people Israel to err."
Jeremiah 23,"14. I have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem an horrible thing: they commit adultery, and walk in lies: they strengthen also the hands of evildoers, that none doth return from his wickedness; they are all of them unto me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah."
Jeremiah 23,"15. Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets; Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink the water of gall: for from the prophets of Jerusalem is profaneness gone forth into all the land."
Jeremiah 23,"16. Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you: they make you vain: they speak a vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of the LORD."
Jeremiah 23,"17. They say still unto them that despise me, The LORD hath said, Ye shall have peace; and they say unto every one that walketh after the imagination of his own heart, No evil shall come upon you."
Jeremiah 23,"18. For who hath stood in the counsel of the LORD, and hath perceived and heard his word? who hath marked his word, and heard it?"
Jeremiah 23,"19. Behold, a whirlwind of the LORD is gone forth in fury, even a grievous whirlwind: it shall fall grievously upon the head of the wicked."
Jeremiah 23,"20. The anger of the LORD shall not return, until he have executed, and till he have performed the thoughts of his heart: in the latter days ye shall consider it perfectly."
Jeremiah 23,"21. I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran: I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied."
Jeremiah 23,"22. But if they had stood in my counsel, and had caused my people to hear my words, then they should have turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings."
Jeremiah 23,"23. Am I a God at hand, saith the LORD, and not a God afar off?"
Jeremiah 23,24. Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him? saith the LORD. Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith the LORD.
Jeremiah 23,"25. I have heard what the prophets said, that prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed."
Jeremiah 23,"26. How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies? yea, they are prophets of the deceit of their own heart;"
Jeremiah 23,"27. Which think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour, as their fathers have forgotten my name for Baal."
Jeremiah 23,"28. The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What is the chaff to the wheat? saith the LORD."
Jeremiah 23,29. Is not my word like as a fire? saith the LORD; and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces?
Jeremiah 23,"30. Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, saith the LORD, that steal my words every one from his neighbour."
Jeremiah 23,"31. Behold, I am against the prophets, saith the LORD, that use their tongues, and say, He saith."
Jeremiah 23,"32. Behold, I am against them that prophesy false dreams, saith the LORD, and do tell them, and cause my people to err by their lies, and by their lightness; yet I sent them not, nor commanded them: therefore they shall not profit this people at all, saith the LORD."
Jeremiah 23,"33. And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask thee, saying, What is the burden of the LORD? thou shalt then say unto them, What burden? I will even forsake you, saith the LORD."
Jeremiah 23,"34. And as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, that shall say, The burden of the LORD, I will even punish that man and his house."
Jeremiah 23,"35. Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour, and every one to his brother, What hath the LORD answered? and, What hath the LORD spoken?"
Jeremiah 23,"36. And the burden of the LORD shall ye mention no more: for every man's word shall be his burden; for ye have perverted the words of the living God, of the LORD of hosts our God."
Jeremiah 23,"37. Thus shalt thou say to the prophet, What hath the LORD answered thee? and, What hath the LORD spoken?"
Jeremiah 23,"38. But since ye say, The burden of the LORD; therefore thus saith the LORD; Because ye say this word, The burden of the LORD, and I have sent unto you, saying, Ye shall not say, The burden of the LORD;"
Jeremiah 23,"39. Therefore, behold, I, even I, will utterly forget you, and I will forsake you, and the city that I gave you and your fathers, and cast you out of my presence:"
Jeremiah 23,"40. And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten."
Jeremiah 24,"1. The LORD shewed me, and, behold, two baskets of figs were set before the temple of the LORD, after that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the carpenters and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon."
Jeremiah 24,"2. One basket had very good figs, even like the figs that are first ripe: and the other basket had very naughty figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad."
Jeremiah 24,"3. Then said the LORD unto me, What seest thou, Jeremiah? And I said, Figs; the good figs, very good; and the evil, very evil, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil."
Jeremiah 24,"4. Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,"
Jeremiah 24,"5. Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Like these good figs, so will I acknowledge them that are carried away captive of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans for their good."
Jeremiah 24,"6. For I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them again to this land: and I will build them, and not pull them down; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up."
Jeremiah 24,"7. And I will give them an heart to know me, that I am the LORD: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God: for they shall return unto me with their whole heart."
Jeremiah 24,"8. And as the evil figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so evil; surely thus saith the LORD, So will I give Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, that remain in this land, and them that dwell in the land of Egypt:"
Jeremiah 24,"9. And I will deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth for their hurt, to be a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places whither I shall drive them."
Jeremiah 24,"10. And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, among them, till they be consumed from off the land that I gave unto them and to their fathers."
Jeremiah 25,"1. The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that was the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon;"
Jeremiah 25,"2. The which Jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the people of Judah, and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying,"
Jeremiah 25,"3. From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, even unto this day, that is the three and twentieth year, the word of the LORD hath come unto me, and I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but ye have not hearkened."
Jeremiah 25,"4. And the LORD hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets, rising early and sending them; but ye have not hearkened, nor inclined your ear to hear."
Jeremiah 25,"5. They said, Turn ye again now every one from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that the LORD hath given unto you and to your fathers for ever and ever:"
Jeremiah 25,"6. And go not after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, and provoke me not to anger with the works of your hands; and I will do you no hurt."
Jeremiah 25,"7. Yet ye have not hearkened unto me, saith the LORD; that ye might provoke me to anger with the works of your hands to your own hurt."
Jeremiah 25,"8. Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts; Because ye have not heard my words,"
Jeremiah 25,"9. Behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, saith the LORD, and Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land, and against the inhabitants thereof, and against all these nations round about, and will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and an hissing, and perpetual desolations."
Jeremiah 25,"10. Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the candle."
Jeremiah 25,"11. And this whole land shall be a desolation, and an astonishment; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years."
Jeremiah 25,"12. And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished, that I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation, saith the LORD, for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans, and will make it perpetual desolations."
Jeremiah 25,"13. And I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced against it, even all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations."
Jeremiah 25,"14. For many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of them also: and I will recompense them according to their deeds, and according to the works of their own hands."
Jeremiah 25,"15. For thus saith the LORD God of Israel unto me; Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send thee, to drink it."
Jeremiah 25,"16. And they shall drink, and be moved, and be mad, because of the sword that I will send among them."
Jeremiah 25,"17. Then took I the cup at the LORD's hand, and made all the nations to drink, unto whom the LORD had sent me:"
Jeremiah 25,"18. To wit, Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and the kings thereof, and the princes thereof, to make them a desolation, an astonishment, an hissing, and a curse; as it is this day;"
Jeremiah 25,"19. Pharaoh king of Egypt, and his servants, and his princes, and all his people;"
Jeremiah 25,"20. And all the mingled people, and all the kings of the land of Uz, and all the kings of the land of the Philistines, and Ashkelon, and Azzah, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod,"
Jeremiah 25,"21. Edom, and Moab, and the children of Ammon,"
Jeremiah 25,"22. And all the kings of Tyrus, and all the kings of Zidon, and the kings of the isles which are beyond the sea,"
Jeremiah 25,"23. Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all that are in the utmost corners,"
Jeremiah 25,"24. And all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mingled people that dwell in the desert,"
Jeremiah 25,"25. And all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes,"
Jeremiah 25,"26. And all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another, and all the kingdoms of the world, which are upon the face of the earth: and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them."
Jeremiah 25,"27. Therefore thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Drink ye, and be drunken, and spue, and fall, and rise no more, because of the sword which I will send among you."
Jeremiah 25,"28. And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to drink, then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Ye shall certainly drink."
Jeremiah 25,"29. For, lo, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my name, and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished: for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith the LORD of hosts."
Jeremiah 25,"30. Therefore prophesy thou against them all these words, and say unto them, The LORD shall roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation; he shall mightily roar upon his habitation; he shall give a shout, as they that tread the grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth."
Jeremiah 25,"31. A noise shall come even to the ends of the earth; for the LORD hath a controversy with the nations, he will plead with all flesh; he will give them that are wicked to the sword, saith the LORD."
Jeremiah 25,"32. Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth."
Jeremiah 25,"33. And the slain of the LORD shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground."
Jeremiah 25,"34. Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the ashes, ye principal of the flock: for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished; and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel."
Jeremiah 25,"35. And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape."
Jeremiah 25,"36. A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and an howling of the principal of the flock, shall be heard: for the LORD hath spoiled their pasture."
Jeremiah 25,37. And the peaceable habitations are cut down because of the fierce anger of the LORD.
Jeremiah 25,"38. He hath forsaken his covert, as the lion: for their land is desolate because of the fierceness of the oppressor, and because of his fierce anger."
Jeremiah 26,"1. In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word from the LORD, saying,"
Jeremiah 26,"2. Thus saith the LORD; Stand in the court of the LORD's house, and speak unto all the cities of Judah, which come to worship in the LORD's house, all the words that I command thee to speak unto them; diminish not a word:"
Jeremiah 26,"3. If so be they will hearken, and turn every man from his evil way, that I may repent me of the evil, which I purpose to do unto them because of the evil of their doings."
Jeremiah 26,"4. And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD; If ye will not hearken to me, to walk in my law, which I have set before you,"
Jeremiah 26,"5. To hearken to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I sent unto you, both rising up early, and sending them, but ye have not hearkened;"
Jeremiah 26,"6. Then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth."
Jeremiah 26,7. So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the LORD.
Jeremiah 26,"8. Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the LORD had commanded him to speak unto all the people, that the priests and the prophets and all the people took him, saying, Thou shalt surely die."
Jeremiah 26,"9. Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant? And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the LORD."
Jeremiah 26,"10. When the princes of Judah heard these things, then they came up from the king's house unto the house of the LORD, and sat down in the entry of the new gate of the LORD's house."
Jeremiah 26,"11. Then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the people, saying, This man is worthy to die; for he hath prophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your ears."
Jeremiah 26,"12. Then spake Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people, saying, The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard."
Jeremiah 26,"13. Therefore now amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the LORD your God; and the LORD will repent him of the evil that he hath pronounced against you."
Jeremiah 26,"14. As for me, behold, I am in your hand: do with me as seemeth good and meet unto you."
Jeremiah 26,"15. But know ye for certain, that if ye put me to death, ye shall surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon this city, and upon the inhabitants thereof: for of a truth the LORD hath sent me unto you to speak all these words in your ears."
Jeremiah 26,16. Then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets; This man is not worthy to die: for he hath spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God.
Jeremiah 26,"17. Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spake to all the assembly of the people, saying,"
Jeremiah 26,"18. Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spake to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Zion shall be plowed like a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest."
Jeremiah 26,"19. Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to death? did he not fear the LORD, and besought the LORD, and the LORD repented him of the evil which he had pronounced against them? Thus might we procure great evil against our souls."
Jeremiah 26,"20. And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the LORD, Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjathjearim, who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah."
Jeremiah 26,"21. And when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men, and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death: but when Urijah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt;"
Jeremiah 26,"22. And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, namely, Elnathan the son of Achbor, and certain men with him into Egypt."
Jeremiah 26,"23. And they fetched forth Urijah out of Egypt, and brought him unto Jehoiakim the king; who slew him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people."
Jeremiah 26,"24. Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death."
Jeremiah 27,"1. In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word unto Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,"
Jeremiah 27,"2. Thus saith the LORD to me; Make thee bonds and yokes, and put them upon thy neck,"
Jeremiah 27,"3. And send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the Ammonites, and to the king of Tyrus, and to the king of Zidon, by the hand of the messengers which come to Jerusalem unto Zedekiah king of Judah;"
Jeremiah 27,"4. And command them to say unto their masters, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say unto your masters;"
Jeremiah 27,"5. I have made the earth, the man and the beast that are upon the ground, by my great power and by my outstretched arm, and have given it unto whom it seemed meet unto me."
Jeremiah 27,"6. And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of the field have I given him also to serve him."
Jeremiah 27,"7. And all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son's son, until the very time of his land come: and then many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of him."
Jeremiah 27,"8. And it shall come to pass, that the nation and kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation will I punish, saith the LORD, with the sword, and with the famine, and with the pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand."
Jeremiah 27,"9. Therefore hearken not ye to your prophets, nor to your diviners, nor to your dreamers, nor to your enchanters, nor to your sorcerers, which speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon:"
Jeremiah 27,"10. For they prophesy a lie unto you, to remove you far from your land; and that I should drive you out, and ye should perish."
Jeremiah 27,"11. But the nations that bring their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him, those will I let remain still in their own land, saith the LORD; and they shall till it, and dwell therein."
Jeremiah 27,"12. I spake also to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words, saying, Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live."
Jeremiah 27,"13. Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as the LORD hath spoken against the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?"
Jeremiah 27,"14. Therefore hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon: for they prophesy a lie unto you."
Jeremiah 27,"15. For I have not sent them, saith the LORD, yet they prophesy a lie in my name; that I might drive you out, and that ye might perish, ye, and the prophets that prophesy unto you."
Jeremiah 27,"16. Also I spake to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Hearken not to the words of your prophets that prophesy unto you, saying, Behold, the vessels of the LORD's house shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon: for they prophesy a lie unto you."
Jeremiah 27,"17. Hearken not unto them; serve the king of Babylon, and live: wherefore should this city be laid waste?"
Jeremiah 27,"18. But if they be prophets, and if the word of the LORD be with them, let them now make intercession to the LORD of hosts, that the vessels which are left in the house of the LORD, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, go not to Babylon."
Jeremiah 27,"19. For thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the residue of the vessels that remain in this city."
Jeremiah 27,"20. Which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem;"
Jeremiah 27,"21. Yea, thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that remain in the house of the LORD, and in the house of the king of Judah and of Jerusalem;"
Jeremiah 27,"22. They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be until the day that I visit them, saith the LORD; then will I bring them up, and restore them to this place."
Jeremiah 28,"1. And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, and in the fifth month, that Hananiah the son of Azur the prophet, which was of Gibeon, spake unto me in the house of the LORD, in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying,"
Jeremiah 28,"2. Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon."
Jeremiah 28,"3. Within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of the LORD's house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place, and carried them to Babylon:"
Jeremiah 28,"4. And I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, that went into Babylon, saith the LORD: for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon."
Jeremiah 28,"5. Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of the LORD,"
Jeremiah 28,"6. Even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen: the LORD do so: the LORD perform thy words which thou hast prophesied, to bring again the vessels of the LORD's house, and all that is carried away captive, from Babylon into this place."
Jeremiah 28,"7. Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears, and in the ears of all the people;"
Jeremiah 28,"8. The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied both against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence."
Jeremiah 28,"9. The prophet which prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known, that the LORD hath truly sent him."
Jeremiah 28,"10. Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah's neck, and brake it."
Jeremiah 28,"11. And Hananiah spake in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all nations within the space of two full years. And the prophet Jeremiah went his way."
Jeremiah 28,"12. Then the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the prophet, after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying,"
Jeremiah 28,"13. Go and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast broken the yokes of wood; but thou shalt make for them yokes of iron."
Jeremiah 28,"14. For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him: and I have given him the beasts of the field also."
Jeremiah 28,"15. Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet, Hear now, Hananiah; The LORD hath not sent thee; but thou makest this people to trust in a lie."
Jeremiah 28,"16. Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will cast thee from off the face of the earth: this year thou shalt die, because thou hast taught rebellion against the LORD."
Jeremiah 28,17. So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.
Jeremiah 29,"1. Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem unto the residue of the elders which were carried away captives, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon;"
Jeremiah 29,"2. (After that Jeconiah the king, and the queen, and the eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the carpenters, and the smiths, were departed from Jerusalem;)"
Jeremiah 29,"3. By the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent unto Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon) saying,"
Jeremiah 29,"4. Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, unto all that are carried away captives, whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem unto Babylon;"
Jeremiah 29,"5. Build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them;"
Jeremiah 29,"6. Take ye wives, and beget sons and daughters; and take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters; that ye may be increased there, and not diminished."
Jeremiah 29,"7. And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be carried away captives, and pray unto the LORD for it: for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace."
Jeremiah 29,"8. For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Let not your prophets and your diviners, that be in the midst of you, deceive you, neither hearken to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed."
Jeremiah 29,"9. For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name: I have not sent them, saith the LORD."
Jeremiah 29,"10. For thus saith the LORD, That after seventy years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you, and perform my good word toward you, in causing you to return to this place."
Jeremiah 29,"11. For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end."
Jeremiah 29,"12. Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you."
Jeremiah 29,"13. And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart."
Jeremiah 29,"14. And I will be found of you, saith the LORD: and I will turn away your captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the places whither I have driven you, saith the LORD; and I will bring you again into the place whence I caused you to be carried away captive."
Jeremiah 29,"15. Because ye have said, The LORD hath raised us up prophets in Babylon;"
Jeremiah 29,"16. Know that thus saith the LORD of the king that sitteth upon the throne of David, and of all the people that dwelleth in this city, and of your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity;"
Jeremiah 29,"17. Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will send upon them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like vile figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil."
Jeremiah 29,"18. And I will persecute them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be removed to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, and an astonishment, and an hissing, and a reproach, among all the nations whither I have driven them:"
Jeremiah 29,"19. Because they have not hearkened to my words, saith the LORD, which I sent unto them by my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them; but ye would not hear, saith the LORD."
Jeremiah 29,"20. Hear ye therefore the word of the LORD, all ye of the captivity, whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon:"
Jeremiah 29,"21. Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, of Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and of Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, which prophesy a lie unto you in my name; Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall slay them before your eyes;"
Jeremiah 29,"22. And of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Judah which are in Babylon, saying, The LORD make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire;"
Jeremiah 29,"23. Because they have committed villany in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbours' wives, and have spoken lying words in my name, which I have not commanded them; even I know, and am a witness, saith the LORD."
Jeremiah 29,"24. Thus shalt thou also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying,"
Jeremiah 29,"25. Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Because thou hast sent letters in thy name unto all the people that are at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying,"
Jeremiah 29,"26. The LORD hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that ye should be officers in the house of the LORD, for every man that is mad, and maketh himself a prophet, that thou shouldest put him in prison, and in the stocks."
Jeremiah 29,"27. Now therefore why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth, which maketh himself a prophet to you?"
Jeremiah 29,"28. For therefore he sent unto us in Babylon, saying, This captivity is long: build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them."
Jeremiah 29,29. And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.
Jeremiah 29,"30. Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,"
Jeremiah 29,"31. Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus saith the LORD concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite; Because that Shemaiah hath prophesied unto you, and I sent him not, and he caused you to trust in a lie:"
Jeremiah 29,"32. Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite, and his seed: he shall not have a man to dwell among this people; neither shall he behold the good that I will do for my people, saith the LORD; because he hath taught rebellion against the LORD."
Jeremiah 30,"1. The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,"
Jeremiah 30,"2. Thus speaketh the LORD God of Israel, saying, Write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book."

Jeremiah 30,4. And these are the words that the LORD spake concerning Israel and concerning Judah.
Jeremiah 30,"5. For thus saith the LORD; We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace."
Jeremiah 30,"6. Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child? wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?"
Jeremiah 30,"7. Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob's trouble, but he shall be saved out of it."
Jeremiah 30,"8. For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, that I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy bonds, and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him:"
Jeremiah 30,"9. But they shall serve the LORD their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them."
Jeremiah 30,"10. Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith the LORD; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be in rest, and be quiet, and none shall make him afraid."
Jeremiah 30,"11. For I am with thee, saith the LORD, to save thee: though I make a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee, yet I will not make a full end of thee: but I will correct thee in measure, and will not leave thee altogether unpunished."
Jeremiah 30,"12. For thus saith the LORD, Thy bruise is incurable, and thy wound is grievous."
Jeremiah 30,"13. There is none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up: thou hast no healing medicines."
Jeremiah 30,"14. All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not; for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the multitude of thine iniquity; because thy sins were increased."
Jeremiah 30,"15. Why criest thou for thine affliction? thy sorrow is incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity: because thy sins were increased, I have done these things unto thee."
Jeremiah 30,"16. Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey."
Jeremiah 30,"17. For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the LORD; because they called thee an Outcast, saying, This is Zion, whom no man seeketh after."
Jeremiah 30,"18. Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will bring again the captivity of Jacob's tents, and have mercy on his dwellingplaces; and the city shall be builded upon her own heap, and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof."
Jeremiah 30,"19. And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small."
Jeremiah 30,"20. Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their congregation shall be established before me, and I will punish all that oppress them."

Jeremiah 31,"1. At the same time, saith the LORD, will I be the God of all the families of Israel, and they shall be my people."
Jeremiah 31,"2. Thus saith the LORD, The people which were left of the sword found grace in the wilderness; even Israel, when I went to cause him to rest."

Jeremiah 31,"4. Again I will build thee, and thou shalt be built, O virgin of Israel: thou shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets, and shalt go forth in the dances of them that make merry."
Jeremiah 31,"5. Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of Samaria: the planters shall plant, and shall eat them as common things."
Jeremiah 31,"6. For there shall be a day, that the watchmen upon the mount Ephraim shall cry, Arise ye, and let us go up to Zion unto the LORD our God."

Jeremiah 31,"10. Hear the word of the LORD, O ye nations, and declare it in the isles afar off, and say, He that scattered Israel will gather him, and keep him, as a shepherd doth his flock."
Jeremiah 31,"11. For the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and ransomed him from the hand of him that was stronger than he."
Jeremiah 31,"12. Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow together to the goodness of the LORD, for wheat, and for wine, and for oil, and for the young of the flock and of the herd: and their soul shall be as a watered garden; and they shall not sorrow any more at all."

Jeremiah 31,"17. And there is hope in thine end, saith the LORD, that thy children shall come again to their own border."
Jeremiah 31,"18. I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus; Thou hast chastised me, and I was chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke: turn thou me, and I shall be turned; for thou art the LORD my God."
Jeremiah 31,"19. Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was instructed, I smote upon my thigh: I was ashamed, yea, even confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth."
Jeremiah 31,"20. Is Ephraim my dear son? is he a pleasant child? for since I spake against him, I do earnestly remember him still: therefore my bowels are troubled for him; I will surely have mercy upon him, saith the LORD."

Jeremiah 31,"29. In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten a sour grape, and the children's teeth are set on edge."

Jeremiah 31,"31. Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:"
Jeremiah 31,"32. Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto them, saith the LORD:"
Jeremiah 31,"33. But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people."
Jeremiah 31,"34. And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the LORD: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the LORD: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more."
Jeremiah 31,"35. Thus saith the LORD, which giveth the sun for a light by day, and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, which divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar; The LORD of hosts is his name:"

Jeremiah 31,"40. And the whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes, and all the fields unto the brook of Kidron, unto the corner of the horse gate toward the east, shall be holy unto the LORD; it shall not be plucked up, nor thrown down any more for ever."
Jeremiah 32,"1. The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar."
Jeremiah 32,"2. For then the king of Babylon's army besieged Jerusalem: and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison, which was in the king of Judah's house."
Jeremiah 32,"3. For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore dost thou prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;"
Jeremiah 32,"4. And Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes;"
Jeremiah 32,"5. And he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I visit him, saith the LORD: though ye fight with the Chaldeans, ye shall not prosper."
Jeremiah 32,"6. And Jeremiah said, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying,"
Jeremiah 32,"7. Behold, Hanameel the son of Shallum thine uncle shall come unto thee saying, Buy thee my field that is in Anathoth: for the right of redemption is thine to buy it."
Jeremiah 32,"8. So Hanameel mine uncle's son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the LORD, and said unto me, Buy my field, I pray thee, that is in Anathoth, which is in the country of Benjamin: for the right of inheritance is thine, and the redemption is thine; buy it for thyself. Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD."
Jeremiah 32,"9. And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle's son, that was in Anathoth, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver."
Jeremiah 32,"10. And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed it, and took witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances."
Jeremiah 32,"11. So I took the evidence of the purchase, both that which was sealed according to the law and custom, and that which was open:"
Jeremiah 32,"12. And I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel mine uncle's son, and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase, before all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison."
Jeremiah 32,"13. And I charged Baruch before them, saying,"
Jeremiah 32,"14. Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Take these evidences, this evidence of the purchase, both which is sealed, and this evidence which is open; and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may continue many days."
Jeremiah 32,"15. For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Houses and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land."
Jeremiah 32,"16. Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed unto the LORD, saying,"
Jeremiah 32,"17. Ah Lord GOD! behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and stretched out arm, and there is nothing too hard for thee:"
Jeremiah 32,"18. Thou shewest lovingkindness unto thousands, and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them: the Great, the Mighty God, the LORD of hosts, is his name,"
Jeremiah 32,"19. Great in counsel, and mighty in work: for thine eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men: to give every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings:"
Jeremiah 32,"20. Which hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even unto this day, and in Israel, and among other men; and hast made thee a name, as at this day;"
Jeremiah 32,"21. And hast brought forth thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with great terror;"
Jeremiah 32,"22. And hast given them this land, which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey;"
Jeremiah 32,"23. And they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not thy voice, neither walked in thy law; they have done nothing of all that thou commandedst them to do: therefore thou hast caused all this evil to come upon them:"
Jeremiah 32,"24. Behold the mounts, they are come unto the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans, that fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence: and what thou hast spoken is come to pass; and, behold, thou seest it."
Jeremiah 32,"25. And thou hast said unto me, O Lord GOD, Buy thee the field for money, and take witnesses; for the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans."
Jeremiah 32,"26. Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,"
Jeremiah 32,"27. Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh: is there any thing too hard for me?"
Jeremiah 32,"28. Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it:"
Jeremiah 32,"29. And the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come and set fire on this city, and burn it with the houses, upon whose roofs they have offered incense unto Baal, and poured out drink offerings unto other gods, to provoke me to anger."
Jeremiah 32,"30. For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only done evil before me from their youth: for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, saith the LORD."
Jeremiah 32,"31. For this city hath been to me as a provocation of mine anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day; that I should remove it from before my face,"
Jeremiah 32,"32. Because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem."
Jeremiah 32,"33. And they have turned unto me the back, and not the face: though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not hearkened to receive instruction."
Jeremiah 32,"34. But they set their abominations in the house, which is called by my name, to defile it."
Jeremiah 32,"35. And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire unto Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin."
Jeremiah 32,"36. And now therefore thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning this city, whereof ye say, It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence;"
Jeremiah 32,"37. Behold, I will gather them out of all countries, whither I have driven them in mine anger, and in my fury, and in great wrath; and I will bring them again unto this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely:"
Jeremiah 32,"38. And they shall be my people, and I will be their God:"
Jeremiah 32,"39. And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them:"
Jeremiah 32,"40. And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me."
Jeremiah 32,"41. Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul."
Jeremiah 32,"42. For thus saith the LORD; Like as I have brought all this great evil upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the good that I have promised them."
Jeremiah 32,"43. And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof ye say, It is desolate without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans."
Jeremiah 32,"44. Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe evidences, and seal them, and take witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the mountains, and in the cities of the valley, and in the cities of the south: for I will cause their captivity to return, saith the LORD."
Jeremiah 33,"1. Moreover the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the second time, while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison, saying,"
Jeremiah 33,"2. Thus saith the LORD the maker thereof, the LORD that formed it, to establish it; the LORD is his name;"
Jeremiah 33,"3. Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and shew thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not."
Jeremiah 33,"4. For thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are thrown down by the mounts, and by the sword;"
Jeremiah 33,"5. They come to fight with the Chaldeans, but it is to fill them with the dead bodies of men, whom I have slain in mine anger and in my fury, and for all whose wickedness I have hid my face from this city."
Jeremiah 33,"6. Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them, and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth."
Jeremiah 33,"7. And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return, and will build them, as at the first."
Jeremiah 33,"8. And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have sinned against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they have sinned, and whereby they have transgressed against me."
Jeremiah 33,"9. And it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and an honour before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that I do unto them: and they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all the prosperity that I procure unto it."
Jeremiah 33,"10. Thus saith the LORD; Again there shall be heard in this place, which ye say shall be desolate without man and without beast, even in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, that are desolate, without man, and without inhabitant, and without beast,"
Jeremiah 33,"11. The voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that shall say, Praise the LORD of hosts: for the LORD is good; for his mercy endureth for ever: and of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the LORD. For I will cause to return the captivity of the land, as at the first, saith the LORD."
Jeremiah 33,"12. Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Again in this place, which is desolate without man and without beast, and in all the cities thereof, shall be an habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down."
Jeremiah 33,"13. In the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the vale, and in the cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him that telleth them, saith the LORD."
Jeremiah 33,"14. Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will perform that good thing which I have promised unto the house of Israel and to the house of Judah."
Jeremiah 33,"15. In those days, and at that time, will I cause the Branch of righteousness to grow up unto David; and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land."
Jeremiah 33,"16. In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely: and this is the name wherewith she shall be called, The LORD our righteousness."
Jeremiah 33,17. For thus saith the LORD; David shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel;
Jeremiah 33,"18. Neither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings, and to kindle meat offerings, and to do sacrifice continually."
Jeremiah 33,"19. And the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, saying,"
Jeremiah 33,"20. Thus saith the LORD; If ye can break my covenant of the day, and my covenant of the night, and that there should not be day and night in their season;"
Jeremiah 33,"21. Then may also my covenant be broken with David my servant, that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne; and with the Levites the priests, my ministers."
Jeremiah 33,"22. As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured: so will I multiply the seed of David my servant, and the Levites that minister unto me."
Jeremiah 33,"23. Moreover the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,"
Jeremiah 33,"24. Considerest thou not what this people have spoken, saying, The two families which the LORD hath chosen, he hath even cast them off? thus they have despised my people, that they should be no more a nation before them."
Jeremiah 33,"25. Thus saith the LORD; If my covenant be not with day and night, and if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth;"
Jeremiah 33,"26. Then will I cast away the seed of Jacob and David my servant, so that I will not take any of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for I will cause their captivity to return, and have mercy on them."
Jeremiah 34,"1. The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth of his dominion, and all the people, fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities thereof, saying,"
Jeremiah 34,"2. Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire:"
Jeremiah 34,"3. And thou shalt not escape out of his hand, but shalt surely be taken, and delivered into his hand; and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth, and thou shalt go to Babylon."
Jeremiah 34,"4. Yet hear the word of the LORD, O Zedekiah king of Judah; Thus saith the LORD of thee, Thou shalt not die by the sword:"
Jeremiah 34,"5. But thou shalt die in peace: and with the burnings of thy fathers, the former kings which were before thee, so shall they burn odours for thee; and they will lament thee, saying, Ah lord! for I have pronounced the word, saith the LORD."
Jeremiah 34,"6. Then Jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem,"
Jeremiah 34,"7. When the king of Babylon's army fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish, and against Azekah: for these defenced cities remained of the cities of Judah."
Jeremiah 34,"8. This is the word that came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, after that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people which were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty unto them;"
Jeremiah 34,"9. That every man should let his manservant, and every man his maidservant, being an Hebrew or an Hebrewess, go free; that none should serve himself of them, to wit, of a Jew his brother."
Jeremiah 34,"10. Now when all the princes, and all the people, which had entered into the covenant, heard that every one should let his manservant, and every one his maidservant, go free, that none should serve themselves of them any more, then they obeyed, and let them go."
Jeremiah 34,"11. But afterward they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids."
Jeremiah 34,"12. Therefore the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,"
Jeremiah 34,"13. Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondmen, saying,"
Jeremiah 34,"14. At the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother an Hebrew, which hath been sold unto thee; and when he hath served thee six years, thou shalt let him go free from thee: but your fathers hearkened not unto me, neither inclined their ear."
Jeremiah 34,"15. And ye were now turned, and had done right in my sight, in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour; and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name:"
Jeremiah 34,"16. But ye turned and polluted my name, and caused every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom he had set at liberty at their pleasure, to return, and brought them into subjection, to be unto you for servants and for handmaids."
Jeremiah 34,"17. Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ye have not hearkened unto me, in proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother, and every man to his neighbour: behold, I proclaim a liberty for you, saith the LORD, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and I will make you to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth."
Jeremiah 34,"18. And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant, which have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me, when they cut the calf in twain, and passed between the parts thereof,"
Jeremiah 34,"19. The princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land, which passed between the parts of the calf;"
Jeremiah 34,"20. I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life: and their dead bodies shall be for meat unto the fowls of the heaven, and to the beasts of the earth."
Jeremiah 34,"21. And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon's army, which are gone up from you."
Jeremiah 34,"22. Behold, I will command, saith the LORD, and cause them to return to this city; and they shall fight against it, and take it, and burn it with fire: and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without an inhabitant."
Jeremiah 35,"1. The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying,"
Jeremiah 35,"2. Go unto the house of the Rechabites, and speak unto them, and bring them into the house of the LORD, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink."
Jeremiah 35,"3. Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habaziniah, and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites;"
Jeremiah 35,"4. And I brought them into the house of the LORD, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, a man of God, which was by the chamber of the princes, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the door:"
Jeremiah 35,"5. And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots full of wine, and cups, and I said unto them, Drink ye wine."
Jeremiah 35,"6. But they said, We will drink no wine: for Jonadab the son of Rechab our father commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no wine, neither ye, nor your sons for ever:"
Jeremiah 35,"7. Neither shall ye build house, nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard, nor have any: but all your days ye shall dwell in tents; that ye may live many days in the land where ye be strangers."
Jeremiah 35,"8. Thus have we obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our father in all that he hath charged us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters;"
Jeremiah 35,"9. Nor to build houses for us to dwell in: neither have we vineyard, nor field, nor seed:"
Jeremiah 35,"10. But we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us."
Jeremiah 35,"11. But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians: so we dwell at Jerusalem."
Jeremiah 35,"12. Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,"
Jeremiah 35,"13. Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Go and tell the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will ye not receive instruction to hearken to my words? saith the LORD."
Jeremiah 35,"14. The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons not to drink wine, are performed; for unto this day they drink none, but obey their father's commandment: notwithstanding I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but ye hearkened not unto me."
Jeremiah 35,"15. I have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, Return ye now every man from his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after other gods to serve them, and ye shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers: but ye have not inclined your ear, nor hearkened unto me."
Jeremiah 35,"16. Because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father, which he commanded them; but this people hath not hearkened unto me:"
Jeremiah 35,"17. Therefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them: because I have spoken unto them, but they have not heard; and I have called unto them, but they have not answered."
Jeremiah 35,"18. And Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Because ye have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts, and done according unto all that he hath commanded you:"
Jeremiah 35,"19. Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever."
Jeremiah 36,"1. And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that this word came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,"
Jeremiah 36,"2. Take thee a roll of a book, and write therein all the words that I have spoken unto thee against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spake unto thee, from the days of Josiah, even unto this day."
Jeremiah 36,3. It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do unto them; that they may return every man from his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.
Jeremiah 36,"4. Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah: and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the LORD, which he had spoken unto him, upon a roll of a book."
Jeremiah 36,"5. And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I cannot go into the house of the LORD:"
Jeremiah 36,"6. Therefore go thou, and read in the roll, which thou hast written from my mouth, the words of the LORD in the ears of the people in the LORD's house upon the fasting day: and also thou shalt read them in the ears of all Judah that come out of their cities."
Jeremiah 36,"7. It may be they will present their supplication before the LORD, and will return every one from his evil way: for great is the anger and the fury that the LORD hath pronounced against this people."
Jeremiah 36,"8. And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book the words of the LORD in the LORD's house."
Jeremiah 36,"9. And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, in the ninth month, that they proclaimed a fast before the LORD to all the people in Jerusalem, and to all the people that came from the cities of Judah unto Jerusalem."
Jeremiah 36,"10. Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the higher court, at the entry of the new gate of the LORD's house, in the ears of all the people."
Jeremiah 36,"11. When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all the words of the LORD,"
Jeremiah 36,"12. Then he went down into the king's house, into the scribe's chamber: and, lo, all the princes sat there, even Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes."
Jeremiah 36,"13. Then Michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people."
Jeremiah 36,"14. Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, unto Baruch, saying, Take in thine hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand, and came unto them."
Jeremiah 36,"15. And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read it in their ears."
Jeremiah 36,"16. Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they were afraid both one and other, and said unto Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words."
Jeremiah 36,"17. And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou write all these words at his mouth?"
Jeremiah 36,"18. Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book."
Jeremiah 36,"19. Then said the princes unto Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and Jeremiah; and let no man know where ye be."
Jeremiah 36,"20. And they went in to the king into the court, but they laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and told all the words in the ears of the king."
Jeremiah 36,"21. So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll: and he took it out of Elishama the scribe's chamber. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king."
Jeremiah 36,22. Now the king sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month: and there was a fire on the hearth burning before him.
Jeremiah 36,"23. And it came to pass, that when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, he cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was on the hearth, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was on the hearth."
Jeremiah 36,"24. Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither the king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words."
Jeremiah 36,25. Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll: but he would not hear them.
Jeremiah 36,"26. But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet: but the LORD hid them."
Jeremiah 36,"27. Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, after that the king had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,"
Jeremiah 36,"28. Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned."
Jeremiah 36,"29. And thou shalt say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast burned this roll, saying, Why hast thou written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast?"
Jeremiah 36,"30. Therefore thus saith the LORD of Jehoiakim king of Judah; He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David: and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost."
Jeremiah 36,"31. And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them; but they hearkened not."
Jeremiah 36,"32. Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire: and there were added besides unto them many like words."
Jeremiah 37,"1. And king Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah."
Jeremiah 37,"2. But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, did hearken unto the words of the LORD, which he spake by the prophet Jeremiah."
Jeremiah 37,"3. And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now unto the LORD our God for us."
Jeremiah 37,4. Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people: for they had not put him into prison.
Jeremiah 37,"5. Then Pharaoh's army was come forth out of Egypt: and when the Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them, they departed from Jerusalem."
Jeremiah 37,"6. Then came the word of the LORD unto the prophet Jeremiah saying,"
Jeremiah 37,"7. Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say to the king of Judah, that sent you unto me to enquire of me; Behold, Pharaoh's army, which is come forth to help you, shall return to Egypt into their own land."
Jeremiah 37,"8. And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city, and take it, and burn it with fire."
Jeremiah 37,"9. Thus saith the LORD; Deceive not yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans shall surely depart from us: for they shall not depart."
Jeremiah 37,"10. For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there remained but wounded men among them, yet should they rise up every man in his tent, and burn this city with fire."
Jeremiah 37,"11. And it came to pass, that when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh's army,"
Jeremiah 37,"12. Then Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to separate himself thence in the midst of the people."
Jeremiah 37,"13. And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he took Jeremiah the prophet, saying, Thou fallest away to the Chaldeans."
Jeremiah 37,"14. Then said Jeremiah, It is false; I fall not away to the Chaldeans. But he hearkened not to him: so Irijah took Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes."
Jeremiah 37,"15. Wherefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe: for they had made that the prison."
Jeremiah 37,"16. When Jeremiah was entered into the dungeon, and into the cabins, and Jeremiah had remained there many days;"
Jeremiah 37,"17. Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took him out: and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there any word from the LORD? And Jeremiah said, There is: for, said he, thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon."
Jeremiah 37,"18. Moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, What have I offended against thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye have put me in prison?"
Jeremiah 37,"19. Where are now your prophets which prophesied unto you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land?"
Jeremiah 37,"20. Therefore hear now, I pray thee, O my lord the king: let my supplication, I pray thee, be accepted before thee; that thou cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there."
Jeremiah 37,"21. Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers' street, until all the bread in the city were spent. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison."
Jeremiah 38,"1. Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of Malchiah, heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken unto all the people, saying,"
Jeremiah 38,"2. Thus saith the LORD, He that remaineth in this city shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live; for he shall have his life for a prey, and shall live."
Jeremiah 38,"3. Thus saith the LORD, This city shall surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon's army, which shall take it."
Jeremiah 38,"4. Therefore the princes said unto the king, We beseech thee, let this man be put to death: for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words unto them: for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people, but the hurt."
Jeremiah 38,"5. Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand: for the king is not he that can do any thing against you."
Jeremiah 38,"6. Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the son of Hammelech, that was in the court of the prison: and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon there was no water, but mire: so Jeremiah sunk in the mire."
Jeremiah 38,"7. Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin;"
Jeremiah 38,"8. Ebedmelech went forth out of the king's house, and spake to the king saying,"
Jeremiah 38,"9. My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is: for there is no more bread in the city."
Jeremiah 38,"10. Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he die."
Jeremiah 38,"11. So Ebedmelech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took thence old cast clouts and old rotten rags, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah."
Jeremiah 38,"12. And Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now these old cast clouts and rotten rags under thine armholes under the cords. And Jeremiah did so."
Jeremiah 38,"13. So they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and took him up out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison."
Jeremiah 38,"14. Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that is in the house of the LORD: and the king said unto Jeremiah, I will ask thee a thing; hide nothing from me."
Jeremiah 38,"15. Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare it unto thee, wilt thou not surely put me to death? and if I give thee counsel, wilt thou not hearken unto me?"
Jeremiah 38,"16. So Zedekiah the king sware secretly unto Jeremiah, saying, As the LORD liveth, that made us this soul, I will not put thee to death, neither will I give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life."
Jeremiah 38,"17. Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; If thou wilt assuredly go forth unto the king of Babylon's princes, then thy soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; and thou shalt live, and thine house:"
Jeremiah 38,"18. But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon's princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand."
Jeremiah 38,"19. And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that are fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me."
Jeremiah 38,"20. But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver thee. Obey, I beseech thee, the voice of the LORD, which I speak unto thee: so it shall be well unto thee, and thy soul shall live."
Jeremiah 38,"21. But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the word that the LORD hath shewed me:"
Jeremiah 38,"22. And, behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judah's house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon's princes, and those women shall say, Thy friends have set thee on, and have prevailed against thee: thy feet are sunk in the mire, and they are turned away back."
Jeremiah 38,"23. So they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans: and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire."
Jeremiah 38,"24. Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and thou shalt not die."
Jeremiah 38,"25. But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they come unto thee, and say unto thee, Declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king, hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to death; also what the king said unto thee:"
Jeremiah 38,"26. Then thou shalt say unto them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan's house, to die there."
Jeremiah 38,"27. Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him: and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived."
Jeremiah 38,28. So Jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day that Jerusalem was taken: and he was there when Jerusalem was taken.
Jeremiah 39,"1. In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem, and they besieged it."
Jeremiah 39,"2. And in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, the city was broken up."
Jeremiah 39,"3. And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, even Nergalsharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, with all the residue of the princes of the king of Babylon."
Jeremiah 39,"4. And it came to pass, that when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw them, and all the men of war, then they fled, and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the king's garden, by the gate betwixt the two walls: and he went out the way of the plain."
Jeremiah 39,"5. But the Chaldeans' army pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he gave judgment upon him."
Jeremiah 39,6. Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah.
Jeremiah 39,"7. Moreover he put out Zedekiah's eyes, and bound him with chains, to carry him to Babylon."
Jeremiah 39,"8. And the Chaldeans burned the king's house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem."
Jeremiah 39,"9. Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to him, with the rest of the people that remained."
Jeremiah 39,"10. But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, which had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time."
Jeremiah 39,"11. Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying,"
Jeremiah 39,"12. Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee."
Jeremiah 39,"13. So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushasban, Rabsaris, and Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, and all the king of Babylon's princes;"
Jeremiah 39,"14. Even they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison, and committed him unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home: so he dwelt among the people."
Jeremiah 39,"15. Now the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, while he was shut up in the court of the prison, saying,"
Jeremiah 39,"16. Go and speak to Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring my words upon this city for evil, and not for good; and they shall be accomplished in that day before thee."
Jeremiah 39,"17. But I will deliver thee in that day, saith the LORD: and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid."
Jeremiah 39,"18. For I will surely deliver thee, and thou shalt not fall by the sword, but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee: because thou hast put thy trust in me, saith the LORD."
Jeremiah 40,"1. The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carried away captive of Jerusalem and Judah, which were carried away captive unto Babylon."
Jeremiah 40,"2. And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said unto him, The LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place."
Jeremiah 40,"3. Now the LORD hath brought it, and done according as he hath said: because ye have sinned against the LORD, and have not obeyed his voice, therefore this thing is come upon you."
Jeremiah 40,"4. And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains which were upon thine hand. If it seem good unto thee to come with me into Babylon, come; and I will look well unto thee: but if it seem ill unto thee to come with me into Babylon, forbear: behold, all the land is before thee: whither it seemeth good and convenient for thee to go, thither go."
Jeremiah 40,"5. Now while he was not yet gone back, he said, Go back also to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon hath made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people: or go wheresoever it seemeth convenient unto thee to go. So the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a reward, and let him go."
Jeremiah 40,6. Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land.
Jeremiah 40,"7. Now when all the captains of the forces which were in the fields, even they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed unto him men, and women, and children, and of the poor of the land, of them that were not carried away captive to Babylon;"
Jeremiah 40,"8. Then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men."
Jeremiah 40,"9. And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan sware unto them and to their men, saying, Fear not to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you."
Jeremiah 40,"10. As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to serve the Chaldeans, which will come unto us: but ye, gather ye wine, and summer fruits, and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that ye have taken."
Jeremiah 40,"11. Likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the Ammonites, and in Edom, and that were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan;"
Jeremiah 40,"12. Even all the Jews returned out of all places whither they were driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, unto Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits very much."
Jeremiah 40,"13. Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah,"
Jeremiah 40,"14. And said unto him, Dost thou certainly know that Baalis the king of the Ammonites hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to slay thee? But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not."
Jeremiah 40,"15. Then Johanan the son of Kareah spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly saying, Let me go, I pray thee, and I will slay Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know it: wherefore should he slay thee, that all the Jews which are gathered unto thee should be scattered, and the remnant in Judah perish?"
Jeremiah 40,"16. But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son of Kareah, Thou shalt not do this thing: for thou speakest falsely of Ishmael."
Jeremiah 41,"1. Now it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, and the princes of the king, even ten men with him, came unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they did eat bread together in Mizpah."
Jeremiah 41,"2. Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land."
Jeremiah 41,"3. Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him, even with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found there, and the men of war."
Jeremiah 41,"4. And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah, and no man knew it,"
Jeremiah 41,"5. That there came certain from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even fourscore men, having their beards shaven, and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with offerings and incense in their hand, to bring them to the house of the LORD."
Jeremiah 41,"6. And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass, as he met them, he said unto them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam."
Jeremiah 41,"7. And it was so, when they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them, and cast them into the midst of the pit, he, and the men that were with him."
Jeremiah 41,"8. But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Slay us not: for we have treasures in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he forbare, and slew them not among their brethren."
Jeremiah 41,"9. Now the pit wherein Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men, whom he had slain because of Gedaliah, was it which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with them that were slain."
Jeremiah 41,"10. Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that were in Mizpah, even the king's daughters, and all the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the Ammonites."
Jeremiah 41,"11. But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,"
Jeremiah 41,"12. Then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon."
Jeremiah 41,"13. Now it came to pass, that when all the people which were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, then they were glad."
Jeremiah 41,"14. So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah cast about and returned, and went unto Johanan the son of Kareah."
Jeremiah 41,"15. But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the Ammonites."
Jeremiah 41,"16. Then took Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after that he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, even mighty men of war, and the women, and the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought again from Gibeon:"
Jeremiah 41,"17. And they departed, and dwelt in the habitation of Chimham, which is by Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt,"
Jeremiah 41,"18. Because of the Chaldeans: for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor in the land."
Jeremiah 42,"1. Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even unto the greatest, came near,"
Jeremiah 42,"2. And said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the LORD thy God, even for all this remnant; (for we are left but a few of many, as thine eyes do behold us:)"
Jeremiah 42,"3. That the LORD thy God may shew us the way wherein we may walk, and the thing that we may do."
Jeremiah 42,"4. Then Jeremiah the prophet said unto them, I have heard you; behold, I will pray unto the LORD your God according to your words; and it shall come to pass, that whatsoever thing the LORD shall answer you, I will declare it unto you; I will keep nothing back from you."
Jeremiah 42,"5. Then they said to Jeremiah, The LORD be a true and faithful witness between us, if we do not even according to all things for the which the LORD thy God shall send thee to us."

Jeremiah 42,"11. Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom ye are afraid; be not afraid of him, saith the LORD: for I am with you to save you, and to deliver you from his hand."
Jeremiah 42,"12. And I will shew mercies unto you, that he may have mercy upon you, and cause you to return to your own land."
Jeremiah 42,"13. But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land, neither obey the voice of the LORD your God,"
Jeremiah 42,"14. Saying, No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor have hunger of bread; and there will we dwell:"
Jeremiah 42,"15. And now therefore hear the word of the LORD, ye remnant of Judah; Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; If ye wholly set your faces to enter into Egypt, and go to sojourn there;"
Jeremiah 42,"16. Then it shall come to pass, that the sword, which ye feared, shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine, whereof ye were afraid, shall follow close after you there in Egypt; and there ye shall die."
Jeremiah 42,"17. So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there; they shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them."
Jeremiah 42,"18. For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As mine anger and my fury hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem; so shall my fury be poured forth upon you, when ye shall enter into Egypt: and ye shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach; and ye shall see this place no more."
Jeremiah 42,"19. The LORD hath said concerning you, O ye remnant of Judah; Go ye not into Egypt: know certainly that I have admonished you this day."
Jeremiah 42,"20. For ye dissembled in your hearts, when ye sent me unto the LORD your God, saying, Pray for us unto the LORD our God; and according unto all that the LORD our God shall say, so declare unto us, and we will do it."
Jeremiah 42,"21. And now I have this day declared it to you; but ye have not obeyed the voice of the LORD your God, nor any thing for the which he hath sent me unto you."
Jeremiah 42,"22. Now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, in the place whither ye desire to go and to sojourn."
Jeremiah 43,"1. And it came to pass, that when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking unto all the people all the words of the LORD their God, for which the LORD their God had sent him to them, even all these words,"
Jeremiah 43,"2. Then spake Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud men, saying unto Jeremiah, Thou speakest falsely: the LORD our God hath not sent thee to say, Go not into Egypt to sojourn there:"
Jeremiah 43,"3. But Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on against us, for to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they might put us to death, and carry us away captives into Babylon."
Jeremiah 43,"4. So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and all the people, obeyed not the voice of the LORD, to dwell in the land of Judah."
Jeremiah 43,"5. But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah, that were returned from all nations, whither they had been driven, to dwell in the land of Judah;"
Jeremiah 43,"6. Even men, and women, and children, and the king's daughters, and every person that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah."
Jeremiah 43,7. So they came into the land of Egypt: for they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: thus came they even to Tahpanhes.
Jeremiah 43,"8. Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying,"
Jeremiah 43,"9. Take great stones in thine hand, and hide them in the clay in the brickkiln, which is at the entry of Pharaoh's house in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah;"
Jeremiah 43,"10. And say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will set his throne upon these stones that I have hid; and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them."
Jeremiah 43,"11. And when he cometh, he shall smite the land of Egypt, and deliver such as are for death to death; and such as are for captivity to captivity; and such as are for the sword to the sword."
Jeremiah 43,"12. And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and he shall burn them, and carry them away captives: and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd putteth on his garment; and he shall go forth from thence in peace."
Jeremiah 43,"13. He shall break also the images of Bethshemesh, that is in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians shall he burn with fire."
Jeremiah 44,"1. The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews which dwell in the land of Egypt, which dwell at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Noph, and in the country of Pathros, saying,"
Jeremiah 44,"2. Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Ye have seen all the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon all the cities of Judah; and, behold, this day they are a desolation, and no man dwelleth therein,"
Jeremiah 44,"3. Because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, and to serve other gods, whom they knew not, neither they, ye, nor your fathers."
Jeremiah 44,"4. Howbeit I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending them, saying, Oh, do not this abominable thing that I hate."
Jeremiah 44,"5. But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense unto other gods."
Jeremiah 44,"6. Wherefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted and desolate, as at this day."
Jeremiah 44,"7. Therefore now thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; Wherefore commit ye this great evil against your souls, to cut off from you man and woman, child and suckling, out of Judah, to leave you none to remain;"
Jeremiah 44,"8. In that ye provoke me unto wrath with the works of your hands, burning incense unto other gods in the land of Egypt, whither ye be gone to dwell, that ye might cut yourselves off, and that ye might be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?"
Jeremiah 44,"9. Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they have committed in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem?"
Jeremiah 44,"10. They are not humbled even unto this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers."
Jeremiah 44,"11. Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, and to cut off all Judah."
Jeremiah 44,"12. And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be consumed, and fall in the land of Egypt; they shall even be consumed by the sword and by the famine: they shall die, from the least even unto the greatest, by the sword and by the famine: and they shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach."
Jeremiah 44,"13. For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence:"
Jeremiah 44,"14. So that none of the remnant of Judah, which are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall escape or remain, that they should return into the land of Judah, to the which they have a desire to return to dwell there: for none shall return but such as shall escape."
Jeremiah 44,"15. Then all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense unto other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great multitude, even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying,"
Jeremiah 44,"16. As for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the LORD, we will not hearken unto thee."
Jeremiah 44,"17. But we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our own mouth, to burn incense unto the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem: for then had we plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil."
Jeremiah 44,"18. But since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, we have wanted all things, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine."
Jeremiah 44,"19. And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out drink offerings unto her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink offerings unto her, without our men?"
Jeremiah 44,"20. Then Jeremiah said unto all the people, to the men, and to the women, and to all the people which had given him that answer, saying,"
Jeremiah 44,"21. The incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye, and your fathers, your kings, and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the LORD remember them, and came it not into his mind?"
Jeremiah 44,"22. So that the LORD could no longer bear, because of the evil of your doings, and because of the abominations which ye have committed; therefore is your land a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without an inhabitant, as at this day."
Jeremiah 44,"23. Because ye have burned incense, and because ye have sinned against the LORD, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD, nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies; therefore this evil is happened unto you, as at this day."
Jeremiah 44,"24. Moreover Jeremiah said unto all the people, and to all the women, Hear the word of the LORD, all Judah that are in the land of Egypt:"
Jeremiah 44,"25. Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying; Ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and fulfilled with your hand, saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her: ye will surely accomplish your vows, and surely perform your vows."
Jeremiah 44,"26. Therefore hear ye the word of the LORD, all Judah that dwell in the land of Egypt; Behold, I have sworn by my great name, saith the LORD, that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, The Lord GOD liveth."
Jeremiah 44,"27. Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good: and all the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until there be an end of them."
Jeremiah 44,"28. Yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, and all the remnant of Judah, that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know whose words shall stand, mine, or their's."
Jeremiah 44,"29. And this shall be a sign unto you, saith the LORD, that I will punish you in this place, that ye may know that my words shall surely stand against you for evil:"
Jeremiah 44,"30. Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give Pharaohhophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his life; as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, his enemy, and that sought his life."
